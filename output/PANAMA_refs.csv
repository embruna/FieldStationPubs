"1","Panama_fine.txt","Aim To provide distribution information and preliminary conservation assessments for all species of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae), one of the most diverse and ecologically important plant groups of the American tropics-a global biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, we aim to analyse patterns of diversity, endemism and the conservation status of the Bromeliaceae on the continental level in the light of their evolutionary history. Location The Americas. Methods We compiled a dataset of occurrence records for 3,272 bromeliad species (93.4% of the family) and modelled their geographic distribution using either climate-based species distribution models, convex hulls or geographic buffers dependent on the number of occurrences available. We then combined this data with information on taxonomy and used the ConR software for a preliminary assessment of the conservation status of all species following Criterion B of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Results Our results stress the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil, the Andean slopes, Central America and the Guiana Highlands as centres of bromeliad diversity and endemism. Phylogenetically ancient subfamilies of bromeliads are centred in the Guiana highlands whereas the large radiations of the group spread across different habitats and large geographic area. A total of 81% of the evaluated bromeliad species are Possibly Threatened with extinction. We provide range polygons for 3,272 species, as well as newly georeferenced point localities for 911 species in the novel ""bromeliad"" r package, together with functions to generate diversity maps for individual taxonomic or functional groups. Main conclusions Diversity centres of the Bromeliaceae agreed with macroecological patterns of other plant and animal groups, but show some particular patterns related to the evolutionary origin of the family, especially ancient dispersal corridors. A staggering 2/3rds of Bromeliaceae species might be threatened with extinction, especially so in tropical rain forests, raising concerns about the conservation of the family and bromeliad-dependent animal species.","Zizka, Alexander

"2","Panama_fine.txt","Pterois volitans (lionfish) is a midsize predatory fish commonly found in waters of the western Pacific and Indian Ocean. The species was first documented in Dania Beach, Florida (northwestern Caribbean) in 1985. Since that time the species has expanded its range rapidly to the Northwestern Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. Since its introduction P. volitans has changed community structure and biodiversity of Caribbean reef communities and other coastal tropical ecosystems. Continuous introductions (accidental or intentional), limited natural predators, naive-range prey behavior, high predation rates on competitors, continuous reproduction, and an extended period of larval dispersal have been the keys for successful invasion and rapid range extension of P. volitans. This invasion has become so severe that it has been recognized as one of the world's top conservation issues. Here, we review the life history, behavior, and historical and contemporary genetic patterns that facilitate expansion and the colonization process. A greater understanding of lionfish biology, ecology, and the changes related to its present condition as a super-invader could improve current and future management strategies and new detection and response methodologies. We also examine new invasion frontiers that this species has the potential to colonize such as the eastern Pacific. This information will provide managers, the scientific community, and the civil society better tools for eradication, control and management of future invasions of this and other invasive species.

"3","Panama_fine.txt","Compassionate conservation focuses on 4 tenets: first, do no harm; individuals matter; inclusivity of individual animals; and peaceful coexistence between humans and animals. Recently, compassionate conservation has been promoted as an alternative to conventional conservation philosophy. We believe examples presented by compassionate conservationists are deliberately or arbitrarily chosen to focus on mammals; inherently not compassionate; and offer ineffective conservation solutions. Compassionate conservation arbitrarily focuses on charismatic species, notably large predators and megaherbivores. The philosophy is not compassionate when it leaves invasive predators in the environment to cause harm to vastly more individuals of native species or uses the fear of harm by apex predators to terrorize mesopredators. Hindering the control of exotic species (megafauna, predators) in situ will not improve the conservation condition of the majority of biodiversity. The positions taken by so-called compassionate conservationists on particular species and on conservation actions could be extended to hinder other forms of conservation, including translocations, conservation fencing, and fertility control. Animal welfare is incredibly important to conservation, but ironically compassionate conservation does not offer the best welfare outcomes to animals and is often ineffective in achieving conservation goals. Consequently, compassionate conservation may threaten public and governmental support for conservation because of the limited understanding of conservation problems by the general public.","Hayward, Matt W.

"4","Panama_fine.txt","This systematic review explores patterns in the peer-reviewed literature related to the integration of multiple values in coastal/marine SES in indigenous settings. We extract metadata from 109 papers across five domains: 1) general study characteristics, 2) transdisciplinarity, 3) methodology, 4) SES elements (and their relationships), and 5) values. We use latent class analysis, descriptive statistics, and different visualization tools to elicit, synthesise and highlight the identified research patterns. Our results suggest that the peer-reviewed literature can be categorised across two main research approaches, contextual research and causal research. The former mainly uses qualitative techniques to study the drivers and pressures in such coastal/marine SES, providing a rather comprehensive understanding of these issues. The latter tends to engage better relevant stakeholders as a means of explaining relationships/impacts within such SES. Furthermore, causal research studies employ a more robust methodological portfolio. We argue that cross-fertilization between these distinct research approaches can contribute towards a more effective integration of different knowledge systems and values in indigenous coastal/marine contexts. In particular, contextual research can point ""where we need to go"", while causal research can employ novel tools to assess in depth the multiple values related to the ecosystem services provided by indigenous coastal/marine SES.","Lam, Rodolfo Dam

The relationships of such indexes with the hydrological, physical and chemical parameters were explored to identify climatic variability or anthropogenic effects on the eutrophication process. Eleven oceanographic sampling campaigns at 25 stations were conducted along the north coast of RdlP from 2009 to 2011. Temperature, salinity and oxygen saturation, water transparency (Secchi depth), chlorophyll (Chl a) content and total nutrient concentrations (total nitrogen and phosphorous) were determined. Trophic indexes (TSI Chl a, TSI TP, TRIX NP-Voll. and TRIX NP-Mvdeo.) were quantified and the RdlP flow was measured. RdlP flow showed significant differences between ENSO phases, with higher values during ""El Nino"" (EN), negative and significant correlations with salinity, Secchi depth and positive with total nutrients. The trophic status indexes showed spatial and temporal variability and associations with flow, physical and chemical parameters. Trophic state indexes showed spatial and temporal heterogeneity and were strongly associated to environmental conditions (hydrological and seasonal oscillations) during the study period but also to the anthropogenic factors affecting the north coast of RdlP. The system has been classified as mesotrophic to hypertrophic, depending on the selected indicator. According to these results, we suggest the use of a multimetric trophic state indicator, i.e., the TRIX index, as explains better the causes and effects of the eutrophication processes. To implement the TRIX index, (TRIX NP-Mvdeo.) we suggest researchers to consider a large number of local records (Chl a, nutrients, oxygen) at seasonal scales. This index is adapted to the environmental conditions of the study zone and complemented with other community structure indexes, and should be used for eutrophication assessment programs in the north coast of RdlP.

Analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) mitochondrial gene as well as cladistic analysis of morphological characters of the weevils indicate four major radiations, with a probable origin on the cycad genus Dioon Lindl. and comparatively recent host shifts onto Zamia L. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene for erotylid beetles indicates that an undescribed genus restricted to New World Ceratozamia Brongn. is the most early-diverging clade, and this lineage is sister to a large radiation of the genus Pharaxonotha onto Zamia, with apparent host shifts onto Dioon and Ceratozamia. Analysis of beetles are in accord with current models of continental drift in the Caribbean basin, support some proposed species groupings of cycads, but not others, and suggest that pollinator type may impact population genetic structure in their host cycads.","Tang, William

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of NPP and its carbon allocation to woody, canopy and root growth components at contrasting lowland West African forests spanning a rainfall gradient. Using a standardized methodology to study evergreen (EF), semi-deciduous (SDF), dry forests (DF) and woody savanna (WS), we find that (i) climate is more closely related with above and belowground C stocks than with NPP (ii) total NPP is highest in the SDF site, then the EF followed by the DF and WS and that (iii) different forest types have distinct carbon allocation patterns whereby SDF allocate in excess of 50% to canopy production and the DF and WS sites allocate 40%-50% to woody production. Furthermore, we find that (iv) compared with canopy and root growth rates the woody growth rate of these forests is a poor proxy for their overall productivity and that (v) residence time is the primary driver in the productivity-allocation-turnover chain for the observed spatial differences in woody, leaf and root biomass across the rainfall gradient. Through a systematic assessment of forest productivity we demonstrate the importance of directly measuring the main components of above and belowground NPP and encourage the establishment of more permanent carbon intensive monitoring plots across the tropics.","Moore, Sam

"11","Panama_fine.txt","The marine flora of Panama harbors a rich diversity of green, red and brown algae, and despite chronic understudy, it is reported as the second most diverse marine flora along the Pacific Central American coast, with 174 macroalgal species. Extensive new collections and molecular assisted identification (MAI) by an international team of researchers has revealed an even greater diversity for this country. Here, the intertidal and shallow subtidal marine flora of the remote Burica Peninsula is introduced. This area is characterized by an uplifted extensive intertidal flat composed of firm, sedimentary benthos known as mudrock, on which abundant algal communities thrive, even during extended periods of exposure. A collection of nearly 200 brown, green and red macroalgae specimens representing the first marine floristic inventory of this region was made in January 2011, and results of analyses of 45 foliose red algae specimens are presented. DNA sequence data for several loci (rbcL-3P; COI-5P; UPA) have been generated for molecular assisted identification and to guide morphological assessments. Twenty-six species were identified among the specimens including 21 new Pacific Panama records, as well as previously unrealized transisthmian distributions, and two new species, Neorubra parvolacertoides sp. nov. and Grateloupia irregularis sp. nov.","Freshwater, David Wilson

The experimental plots were cultivated with the IDIAP-38 rice variety, without previous anthropic intervention. The random recollection of 30 samples in 1000cm(3) from soils of each experimental plots was performed at 70 days after seeding. The samples were processed using a Berlese funnel and the Collembola individuals were identified and quantified to family level. The assessed edaphic variables were determined through principal component analysis (PCA) and represented by means of the explanation of the total data variance. The correlation between the Collembola families and the selected soil parameters was analyzed by means of the Spearman test (r(S); p < 0.05). The total number of collected individuals was 28 249, distributed in nine families, and presented statistical differences between the three sampled areas. The organic matter and the soil humidity presented positive interactions with the families Isotomidae, Sminthuridae and Sminthurididae, which were considered dominant for these crops. The reduced reported populations of Brachystomellidae, Entomobryidae, Dycirtomidae, Hypogastruridae, Onychiuridae and Paronellidae families suggest the vulnerability of the studied edaphic variables, lower than 10%.","Zachrisson, Bruno

"13","Panama_fine.txt","Sessile organisms such as octocorals cannot avoid threats such as predation, parasitism or fungal infections through evasive responses. Instead, they rely on strategies that deter or reduce the impact of these threats. One such strategy is the development of hard structures such as sclerites, which are minute calcium carbonate skeletal elements located on top of the ectoderm and within the mesoglea and gastrodermal tube walls. Sclerites have multiple roles, including structural support of the colony and protection from predators. The role of sclerites as a physical barrier that deters fungal infection, however, is unknown. This study examines the potential role of sea fan sclerites as protection from fungal infection. To accomplish this, four different fungi isolated from healthy sea fans were inoculated into 5 mL tubes filled with culture media and with sclerites from healthy and diseased fans placed on top. To determine whether chemical compounds in the sclerites impact infection, sclerites from healthy and diseased fans were extracted for several days with acetone prior to inoculation. Results showed that the sclerite layer delayed fungal infection from reaching the agar when compared to controls (tubes with agar but no sclerites). There was no difference between tubes with healthy and diseased sclerites, but there were differences among sclerites extracted with acetone. This study suggests that, in addition to the roles in structural support and predator deterrence, sclerites play a role as physical and chemical barriers against to fungal infection.

"14","Panama_fine.txt","Ocean acidification (OA), the process by which increasing atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by the ocean, lowering the pH of surface waters, has been shown to affect many marine organisms negatively. It has been suggested that organisms from regions with naturally low pH waters, such as upwelling areas, could serve as models for future effects of OA and may be adapted to increased pCO(2) levels. In this study, we examined the effects of OA on yellowfin tuna, a highly pelagic species that spawns in the eastern tropical Pacific, an area that includes regions of strong upwelling events. Larvae reared at decreasing pH levels (pH 8.1, 7.6, 7.3 and 6.9) showed increasing organ damage in the kidney, liver, pancreas, eye and muscle, which correlated with decreased growth and survival. These findings complement earlier studies on organ damage in Atlantic cod and herring larvae and demonstrate that OA may have detrimental effects on fish larvae, regardless of their pre-exposure to low pH waters.

To evaluate the distribution of rickettsiae in Panamanian ticks, we collected questing and on-host ticks in urban and rural towns in elevations varying between 0 and 2300 m. A total of 63 sites (13 urban and 50 rural towns) were used to develop models of spatial distributions. We found the following tick species: Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. (present in 54 of 63 towns and cities), Amblyomma mixtum (45/63), Dermacentor nitens (40/63), A. ovale (37/63), Rhipicephalus microplus (33/63), A. oblongoguttatum (33/63), Ixodes affinis (3/63), and Ixodes boliviensis (2/63). Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. was present in urban and rural towns, and other species were present only in rural towns. DNA was extracted from 408 R. sanguineus s.l., 387 A. mixtum, 103 A. ovale, and 11 A. oblongoguttatum and later tested for rickettsiae genes using PCR. Rickettsia DNA was detected in ticks from 21 of 63 localities. Rickettsia rickettsii was detected in five A. mixtum (1.29%), and Candidatus ""Rickettsia amblyommii"" was found in 138 A. mixtum (35%), 14 R. sanguineus (3.4%), and one A. ovale (0.9%). These results suggest that much of rural Panama is suitable for the expansion of tick populations and could favor the appearance of new tick-borne rickettsiosis outbreaks.","Bermudez, Sergio E.

"17","Panama_fine.txt","Background: Nematodes are a very diverse and extremely abundant group of animals, but their occurrence in the tropics is surprisingly little understood. We investigated the meiofauna of epiphytic tank bromeliads in the lowlands of Panama with particular emphasis on nematodes.
Results: We encountered 89 morphospecies of nematodes in 54 bromeliad tanks, which were sampled in the wet and the dry season. Rotifers were by far the most abundant group in both the dry and the wet season (with up to 960 individual ml(-1)), followed by nematodes, annelids and harpacticoid copepods. Individual plants hosted up to 25 nematode species. These nematodes represented a diversity of feeding guilds, suction-feeders and deposit-feeders being most abundant. The relative abundances of feeding-types of nematodes differed considerably in the wet and dry season. Both species richness and abundance were strongly correlated with the size of the phytotelms and the season, while species diversity assessed with the Shannon-index was affected by neither of the two.
Conclusion: This is the first study with a particular focus on the diversity of nematodes in tank bromeliads. We document a meiofauna of considerable abundance and diversity, which suggests important functional roles in ecological processes such as decomposition, which in turn warrants further study.","Zotz, Gerhard

"18","Panama_fine.txt","Parasites are a major force in evolution, and understanding how host life history affects parasite pressure and investment in disease resistance is a general problem in evolutionary biology. The threat of disease may be especially strong in social animals, and ants have evolved the unique metapleural gland (MG), which in many taxa produce antimicrobial compounds that have been argued to have been a key to their ecological success. However, the importance of the MG in the disease resistance of individual ants across ant taxa has not been examined directly. We investigate experimentally the importance of the MG for disease resistance in the fungus-growing ants, a group in which there is interspecific variation in MG size and which has distinct transitions in life history. We find that more derived taxa rely more on the MG for disease resistance than more basal taxa and that there are a series of evolutionary transitions in the quality, quantity, and usage of the MG secretions, which correlate with transitions in life history. These shifts show how even small clades can exhibit substantial transitions in disease resistance investment, demonstrating that host-parasite relationships can be very dynamic and that targeted experimental, as well as large-scale, comparative studies can be valuable for identifying evolutionary transitions.","Tranter, Christopher

"19","Panama_fine.txt","In the present study, conducted in a secondary dry-seasonal forest in the pacific lowlands of southwestern Panama over 2 years, fungal diversity is linked to plant phenology, litter, and climatic data. Agaricales fungi showed maximum species richness at the beginning of rainy seasons, probably due to the important litter accumulation during the dry season and the increase in humidity favoring fungal growth. Species richness declined during the wet season possibly due to torrential rains, moulds, and decreasing availability of nutrients. Occurrence of foliar pathogenic microfungi correlated negatively with flushing of new leaves at the beginning of the rainy season. Their incidence increased during the wet season and remained high during the dry season. Synchronization of leaf shedding in most tree species significantly reduced the yearly incidence of foliar pathogenic fungi causing an annual turn-over of fungal pathogens that probably contributes to maintain a high diversity of plant pathogenic species.

"20","Panama_fine.txt","During early development, many aposematic species have bright and conspicuous warning appearance, but have yet to acquire chemical defenses, a phenotypic state which presumably makes them vulnerable to predation. Body size and signal luminance in particular are known to be sensitive to variation in early nutrition. However, the relative importance of these traits as determinants of predation risk in juveniles is not known. To address this question, we utilized computer-assisted design (CAD) and information on putative predator visual sensitivities to produce artificial models of postmetamorphic froglets that varied in terms of body size and signal luminance. We then deployed the artificial models in the field and measured rates of attack by birds and unknown predators. Our results indicate that body size was a significant predictor of artificial prey survival. Rates of attack by bird predators were significantly higher on smaller models. However, predation by birds did not differ between artificial models of varying signal luminance. This suggests that at the completion of metamorphosis, smaller froglets may be at a selective disadvantage, potentially because predators can discern they have relatively low levels of chemical defense compared to larger froglets. There is likely to be a premium on efficient foraging, giving rise to rapid growth and the acquisition of toxins from dietary sources in juvenile poison frogs.","Flores, Eric E.

"21","Panama_fine.txt","Understanding what mechanisms shape the diversity and composition of biological assemblages across broad-scale gradients is central to ecology. Litter-consuming detritivorous invertebrates in streams show an unusual diversity gradient, with -diversity increasing towards high latitudes but no trend in -diversity. We hypothesized this pattern to be related to shifts in nestedness and several ecological processes shaping their assemblages (dispersal, environmental filtering and competition). We tested this hypothesis, using a global dataset, by examining latitudinal trends in nestedness and several indicators of the above processes along the latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that strong environmental filtering and low dispersal in the tropics lead to often species-poor local detritivore assemblages, nested in richer regional assemblages. At higher latitudes, dispersal becomes stronger, disrupting the nested assemblage structure and resulting in local assemblages that are generally more species-rich and non-nested subsets of the regional species pools. Our results provide evidence that mechanisms underlying assemblage composition and diversity of stream litter-consuming detritivores shift across latitudes, and provide an explanation for their unusual pattern of increasing -diversity with latitude. When we repeated these analyses for whole invertebrate assemblages of leaf litter and for abundant taxa showing reverse or no diversity gradients we found no latitudinal patterns, suggesting that function-based rather than taxon-based analyses of assemblages may help elucidate the mechanisms behind diversity gradients.","Boyero, Luz

"22","Panama_fine.txt","Many forested headwater streams are heterotrophic ecosystems in which allochthonous inputs of plant litter are a major source of energy. Leaves of riparian vegetation entering the stream are broken down by a combination of biotic and abiotic processes and, in most temperate and boreal streams, provide food and habitat for dense populations of detritivorous invertebrates. However, tropical streams in different parts of the world show substantial variability in the number and diversity of leaf-shredding detritivores (hereafter detritivores). We used data obtained with standardized methods from multiple streams in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Australia to test the hypothesis that this variability would lead to differences in the relative role of detritivores and microorganisms in the breakdown process. We also tested the hypotheses that variability in litter breakdown rates changes with litter type (native litter mixtures vs nonnative alder [Alnus glutinosa]) and is higher across regions within than outside the tropics. We found that litter breakdown rates were highly variable across sites, with no consistent pattern within geographic areas, although litter consumption by detritivores was negligible at several sites, all in America. Geographic patterns of litter breakdown also varied between litter types, with higher breakdown rates for alder than for native litter in most but not all regions. When litter breakdown rates at the tropical sites were compared to previously reported values from temperate and boreal regions, we found that differences in variability between tropical and temperate sites were inconsistent, with great differences among studies. Further global-scale studies will be needed to assess the extent to which latitudinal changes in the diversity and composition of microbial and detritivore assemblages contribute to variability in litter breakdown rates.","Boyero, Luz

"26","Panama_fine.txt","Many studies analyzing the relative contribution of soil properties versus distance-related processes on plant species composition have focused on lowland tropical forests. Very few have investigated two forest types simultaneously, to contrast ecological processes that assemble the communities. This study analysesat the landscape scalethe relative contribution of soil and distance on lowland and submontane tropical forests, which co-occur in two reserves of the Azuero peninsula (Panama). Floristic inventories and soil sampling were conducted in 81 0.1-ha plots clustered in 27 sites, and data were analyzed using Mantel tests, variance partitioning and non-metric multidimensional scaling. The largest differences in floristic composition occurred between reserves in both forest types. Soil variation and geographic distance were important determinants of floristic composition, but their effects were highly correlated; together they explained 7-25 percent and 46-50 percent of the variation in lowland and submontane forests, respectively. Soil variables that had the best correlations with floristic composition were iron, zinc, and silt content in lowland, and calcium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and sand content in submontane forests. The studied forests showed a high beta diversity that seems to be related primarily with soils and, secondarily, with dispersal limitation and stochastic events. The results reveal a response of tree assemblages to environmental gradients, which are particularly conspicuous in Panama. The effects of limited dispersal seem to be more important in submontane than in lowland forests, probably as a result of higher isolation.
Resumen Muchos estudios que analizan la contribucion relativa de las propiedades del suelo y de los procesos relacionados con la distancia geografica sobre la composicion floristica se han centrado en bosques tropicales de tierras bajas. Sin embargo, muy pocos han analizado los efectos de esos factores sobre la composicion floristica de dos tipos de bosque simultaneamente. Este estudio investiga -a escala de paisaje- la contribucion relativa del suelo y la distancia sobre la composicion de bosques semi-caducifolios de tierras bajas y bosques ombrofilos submontanos, que cohabitan en dos reservas forestales de la peninsula de Azuero (Panama). Para ello, analizamos los datos de inventarios floristicos y muestras de suelo en 81 parcelas de 0.1ha agrupadas en 27 localidades mediante test de Mantel, particion de la varianza y escalamiento multidimensional no metrico. Los resultados mostraron una mayor diferencia entre la composicion de ambas reservas que entre tipos de bosque. El suelo y la distancia tuvieron un efecto importante en la composicion floristica dentro de las reservas, aunque ambos estuvieron muy correlacionados y, en promedio, explicaron de forma conjunta entre un 7 y un 25% y entre un 46 y un 50% de la variacion en la composicion de bosques de tierras bajas y submontanos respectivamente. Las variables edaficas mas correlacionadas con el patron floristico fueron hierro, zinc y contenido de limo para los bosques de tierras bajas, y calcio, cobre, hierro, potasio, magnesio, fosforo, zinc y contenido de arena para los bosques submontanos. Los bosques analizados muestran una alta diversidad beta que parece estar relacionada en primer lugar con las propiedades del suelo, y en segundo lugar con la limitacion en la dispersion y otros procesos estocasticos. Estos resultados sugieren la existencia de gradientes ambientales acusados sobre los ensamblajes de arboles en Panama. En general, el efecto de la limitacion en la dispersion es mayor en bosques submontanos, como consecuencia probablemente de un mayor aislamiento.","Garibaldi, Cristina

"27","Panama_fine.txt","Experience with payments for ecosystem services (PES) highlights the effects of program design on landowner participation, impacting the program's ability to achieve environmental and, where applicable, social objectives. We conducted an exploratory study in western Panama at the initial stage of PES consideration to identify potential landowner interest in PES and factors that would affect landowner interest and eligibility. We report the results from a household survey of 344 farmers and ranchers (92% response rate). Eighty percent of the respondents expressed interest in PES participation. Respondents' stated interest was significantly related to farm size, income, age, land tenure, and previous involvement in conservation. We also found that alternative specifications for landowner eligibility requirements, targeting criteria, and other parameters could greatly affect landowners' ability to participate, most strongly for respondents lower in socioeconomic status. We provide a framework for exploring potential landowner interest in PES at the very first stage of program exploration, from which program design can be strategically advanced with realistic PES scenarios to explore efficient payment levels and projected environmental benefits. Our findings highlight the importance of making explicit trade-offs that result from alternative PES design choices in affecting landowners' interest and eligibility to participate.

"28","Panama_fine.txt","Adaptive radiation can be strongly influenced by interspecific competition for resources, which can lead to diverse outcomes ranging from competitive exclusion to character displacement. In each case, sympatric species are expected to evolve into distinct ecological niches, such as different food types, yet this expectation is not always met when such species are examined in nature. The most common hypotheses to account for the coexistence of species with substantial diet overlap rest on temporal variation in niches (often diets). Yet spatial variation in niche overlap might also be important, pointing to the need for spatiotemporal analyses of diet and diet overlap between closely related species persisting in sympatry. We here perform such an analysis by characterizing the diets of, and diet overlap among, four sympatric Darwin's ground finch species at three sites and over 5years on a single Galapagos island (Santa Cruz). We find that the different species have broadly similar and overlapping diets - they are to some extent generalists and opportunists - yet we also find that each species retains some private' resources for which their morphologies are best suited. Importantly, use of these private resources increased considerably, and diet overlap decreased accordingly, when the availability of preferred shared foods, such as arthropods, was reduced during drought conditions. Spatial variation in food resources was also important. These results together suggest that the ground finches are imperfect generalists' that use overlapping resources under benign conditions (in space or time), but then retreat to resources for which they are best adapted during periods of food limitation. These conditions likely promote local and regional coexistence.","De Leon, L. F.

"29","Panama_fine.txt","In lek mating systems, females choose mates through indicators of quality, which males may exhibit by their performance of courtship displays. In temperate regions, displaying seasons are brief (one to two months), whereas in the tropics courtship seasons may be prolonged. Moreover, in temperate-breeding animals lekking behaviour can be energetically demanding, but little is known about the energy costs of lekking in tropical animals. Daily, over the course of a nearly seven-month-long breeding season, male golden-collared manakins (Manacus vitellinus) of Panamanian rainforests perform acrobatic courtship displays that markedly elevate heart rates, suggesting that they require high energy investment. Typically, animals of tropical lowland forests (such as manakins) exhibit a 'slow pace of life' metabolic strategy. We investigated whether male manakin courtship is indeed metabolically costly or whether the birds retain a low daily energy expenditure (DEE), as seen in other tropical species. To assess these questions, we calibrated manakin heart rate against metabolic rate, examined daily lek activity and, using telemetry, obtained heart rates of individual wild, lekking male manakins. Although metabolic rates peak during courtship displays, we found that males actually invest minimal time (only approx. 5 min d(-1)) performing displays. As a consequence, the DEE of approximately 39 kJ d(-1) for male manakins is comparable to other lowland tropical species. The short, intense bursts of courtship by these birds make up only approximately 1.2% of their total DEE. Presumably, this cost is negligible, enabling them to perform daily at their arenas for months on end.","Barske, J.

"30","Panama_fine.txt","Mangroves provide several ecosystems services including carbon storage. Aboveground biomass as a proxy for carbon storage and stand structure were investigated in nine plots located in a riverine Pelliciera rhizophorae forest, Gulf of Montijo Ramsar Site, Pacific Coast, Panama. Aboveground biomass for all trees above 2 cm was estimated using common pan-tropical mangrove biomass regression models. Despite a comparatively low tree species diversity there was a considerable variation in stand structure and biomass among the plots. P. rhizophorae dominated the river and center plots with tree densities between 1,275 and 10,075 trees ha(-1). Further inland, species composition shifted towards a Rhizophora racemosa dominated forest. Lower density of larger trees in the inland plots may be due to small-scale cutting of trees at the forest margin. Across all plots, P. rhizophorae was smaller in diameter and height than R. racemosa. Aboveground biomass ranged from 76 Mg ha(-1) to 335 Mg ha(-1) (average: 176 Mg ha(-1)) and was closely related to stem density and basal area. Compared to other neotropical mangrove forests this riverine P. rhizophorae forest stores substantial amounts of biomass. Conservation strategies have to be put in place to maintain the threatened P. rhizophorae forest in Central America.","Gross, Jessica

"32","Panama_fine.txt","Native hardwood trees are frequently planted to restore forest cover to abandoned agricultural lands in the Neotropics. Few studies compare rainfall interception in such plantations and the vegetation the trees are planted to replace. We compared throughfall (TF) and stemflow (SF) in a mature stand of wild sugar cane Saccharum spontaneum L. and six tropical hardwoods growing in a restoration trial in the Republic of Panama. Interception in trees was dominated by TF, with SF accounting for less than 3% of gross rainfall (Pg). By contrast, SF was a dominant means by which rainfall reached the ground in S. spontaneum, and this dominance became greater at higher Pg. Slopes of Pg/SF regressions were considerably steeper in S. spontaneum than among tree plots. We tentatively concluded that trees intercept more rainfall than S. spontaneum. However, median total I was negative in S. spontaneum when SF was estimated using the median and the median plus maximum absolute deviation of stem densities as a multiplier. Sources of potential bias in S. spontaneum measurements include overestimation of stem density, high inter-event variability of water volumes in individual SF collectors, and contact between stems diverting SFs. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to compare I in restoration plantings of tropical hardwoods and in S. spontaneum. It is also only the second study to quantify TF and SF in a sugar cane, likely due to the methodological difficulties involved in retrieving reliable estimates of these variables in very dense grass stands.

"33","Panama_fine.txt","Fungal infections are increasing worldwide, including in the aquatic environment. Microbiota that coexist with marine life can provide protection against fungal infections by secretion of metabolites with antifungal properties. Our laboratory has developed mass spectrometric methodologies with the goal of improving our functional understanding of microbial metabolites and guiding the discovery process of anti-infective agents from natural sources. GA40, a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain isolated from an octocoral in Panama, displayed antifungal activity against various terrestrial and marine fungal strains. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS), the molecular species produced by this microbe were visualized in a side-by-side interaction with two representative fungal strains, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger. The visualization was performed directly on the agar without the need for extraction. By evaluating the spatial distributions, relative intensities and m/z values of GA40 secreted metabolites in the fungal interactions and singly grown control colonies, we obtained insight into the antifungal activity of secreted metabolites. Annotation of GA40 metabolites observed in MALDI-IMS was facilitated by MS/MS networking analysis, a mass spectrometric technique that clusters metabolites with similar MS/MS fragmentation patterns. This analysis established that the predominant GA40 metabolites belong to the iturin family. In a fungal inhibition assay of A. fumigatus, the GA40 iturin metabolites were found to be responsible for the antifungal properties of this Bacillus strain.","Moree, Wilna J.

"34","Panama_fine.txt","Since 2004, governments and non-governmental organizations, together with the fishing communities from nine countries, from Mexico to Peru, have implemented joint efforts to reduce incidental mortality of sea turtles in artisanal longline fisheries of the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). These countries are involved in a Regional Sea Turtle Bycatch Program to achieve this goal. Circle hooks have been proposed as a way to mitigate incidental mortality of sea turtles. Thus, we analyze the performance of circle hooks in relation to)style and tuna hooks on the hooking rates of target and non-target species in the artisanal surface longline fisheries of three of the participating countries with the largest sample sizes (Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica). These fisheries target mahi-mahi, Coryphaena hippurus, or a combination of tunas, billfishes and sharks (TBS), and use different techniques and gear configurations to catch their targets. For the TBS fishery we presented the results of comparisons between tuna hooks and 16/0 circle hooks from Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica, and between tuna hooks and 18/0 circle hooks in Costa Rica. For the mahi-mahi fishery, we analyzed the performance of 14/0 and 15/0 circle hooks in Ecuadorian vessels and 16/0 circle hooks in Costa Rican vessels vs. the traditional J-style hooks. A total of 730,362 hooks were observed in 3126 sets. Hooking rates for target and non-target species were not consistent for all fisheries and countries analyzed. However, circle hooks reduced sea turtle hooking rates in most of the comparisons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Andraka, Sandra

"35","Panama_fine.txt","Timber tree plantations are considered for rehabilitating forest biodiversity in the tropics, but knowledge on determinants of faunal diversity patterns in such human-modified forest landscapes is scarce. We quantified the composition of beetle assemblages on three native timber species (Anacardium excelsum, Cedrela odorata and Tabebuia rosea) planted on former pasture to assess effects of tree species identity, tree species diversity, and insecticide treatment on a speciose group of animals in tropical plantations. The beetle assemblage parameters 'abundance', 'species richness', 'Chao1 estimated species richness' and 'Shannon diversity' were significantly reduced by insecticide treatment for each tree species. Shannon diversity increased with stand diversification for T. rosea but not for A. excelsum and C. odorata. Species similarity was highest (lowest species turnover) between beetle assemblages on T. rosea, and it was lowest (highest species turnover) for assemblages on insecticide-treated trees of all timber species. Considering trophic guilds, herbivorous beetles dominated on all tree species and in all planting schemes. Herbivores were significantly more dominant on T. rosea and C. odorata than on A. excelsum, suggesting that tree species identity affects beetle guild structure on plantation trees. Insecticide-treated stands harbored less herbivores than untreated stands, but exhibited a high abundance of predator beetle species. Our study revealed that even young pasture-afforestations can host diverse beetle assemblages and thus contribute to biodiversity conservation in the tropics. The magnitude of this contribution, however, may strongly depend on management measures and on the selected tree species.","Plath, Mirco

The 24 sampling events yielded approximately 4,000 records of plants corresponding to 311 species as well as 1,614 records of fungi corresponding to approximately 567 species. Lists of more or less certain names of plants and fungi as well as voucher specimens are provided. The randomized species accumulation curve for plants approaches an asymptote and estimators yield stable values of 310-318 predicted plant species in the area of investigation. The curve for records of fungal species, however, did not saturate and all applied estimator functions failed to predict the total richness of fungi for the area convincingly. Two plant collections correspond to new records for Panama and 54 species and infraspecific taxa are new for the Chiriqui province. The identification of fungi is still in process and yielded two species probably new to science as well as 17 new records of species for Panama to date. In order to assess biodiversity patterns (e.g. fungi to plant ratios) of tropical fungi more accurately, it is necessary to repeat such investigations in other areas and to improve the tools for taxonomic identification of these highly diverse but mostly microscopic organisms.","Piepenbring, M.

We tested the associational effects of tree diversity on herbivory patterns of the tropical focal tree in an experimental plantation setup, which contained tree monocultures and mixed stands. We found higher herbivore damage to at higher tree diversity, indicating that did not benefit from associational resistance but rather experienced associational susceptibility. The specific consideration of the two dominant insect herbivore species of , the specialist chrysomelid and the specialist pyralid , facilitated understanding of the detected damage patterns Tree diversity exerted opposite effects on tree infestation by the two herbivores. These findings point to resource concentration effects for the chrysomelid beetle (favored by tree monoculture) and to resource dilution effects for the pyralid caterpillar (favored by tree mixture) as underlying mechanisms of herbivore distribution. A strong contribution of the pyralid to overall damage patterns in diversified stands suggests that associational susceptibility may not necessarily be related to higher abundances of generalist herbivores but may also result from specialized herbivores affected by resource dilution effects. Thus, the identity and biology of herbivore species has to be taken into account when attempting to predict damage patterns in forest ecosystems.","Plath, Mirco

"39","Panama_fine.txt","Aim We tested the hypothesis that shredder detritivores, a key trophic guild in stream ecosystems, are more diverse at higher latitudes, which has important ecological implications in the face of potential biodiversity losses that are expected as a result of climate change. We also explored the dependence of local shredder diversity on the regional species pool across latitudes, and examined the influence of environmental factors on shredder diversity.
Location World-wide (156 sites from 17 regions located in all inhabited continents at latitudes ranging from 67 degrees N to 41 S).
Methods We used linear regression to examine the latitudinal variation in shredder diversity at different spatial scales: alpha (alpha), gamma (gamma) and beta (beta) diversity. We also explored the effect of gamma-diversity on alpha-diversity across latitudes with regression analysis, and the possible influence of local environmental factors on shredder diversity with simple correlations.
Results Alpha diversity increased with latitude, while gamma- and beta-diversity showed no clear latitudinal pattern. Temperate sites showed a linear relationship between gamma- and alpha-diversity; in contrast, tropical sites showed evidence of local species saturation, whichmay explain why the latitudinal gradient in alpha-diversity is not accompanied by a gradient in gamma-diversity. Alpha diversity was related to several local habitat characteristics, but gamma- and beta-diversity were not related to any of the environmental factors measured.
Main conclusions Our results indicate that global patterns of shredder diversity are complex and depend on spatial scale. However, we can draw several conclusions that have important ecological implications. Alpha diversity is limited at tropical sites by local factors, implying a higher risk of loss of key species or the whole shredder guild (the latter implying the loss of trophic diversity). Even if regional species pools are not particularly species poor in the tropics, colonization from adjacent sites may be limited. Moreover, many shredder species belong to cool-adapted taxa that may be close to their thermal maxima in the tropics, which makes them more vulnerable to climate warming. Our results suggest that tropical streams require specific scientific attention and conservation efforts to prevent loss of shredder biodiversity and serious alteration of ecosystem processes.","Boyero, Luz

"40","Panama_fine.txt","For the Dari,n Province, an area larger than Jamaica in Eastern Panama, up to now only 19 species of fungi, mainly lichens and plant parasitic microfungi, have been known. Two general mycological forays including most major groups of fungi were carried out in this area for the first time. During 3 days mostly in secondary vegetation and 2 days in pristine forest, about 104 specimens of macro- and microfungi were collected, of which 85 were identified as 76 species of which all but one were new records for the Dari,n Province. As a result, knowledge on fungal taxa in that region has risen from 19 to 94, i.e. by a factor of five. Although common and easily-spotted species were preferred during collection, 16 (more than 20%) of the species identified were new for Panama, notably two species of Agaricales, Hygroaster nodulisporus and Leucopaxillus gracillimus, and four microfungi on plants, Cercosporella leucaenae, Coccomyces delta, Meliola bixae, and Stigmina anacardii. The records of the species are presented together with specimen data, references, and photos of selected species. As shown by this study, fungi in tropical Panama are highly diverse, mostly unknown, and further mycological field work is urgently needed because habitats are destroyed and fungi specific to them are lost forever.","Piepenbring, M.

"42","Panama_fine.txt","Most hypotheses explaining the general gradient of higher diversity toward the equator are implicit or explicit about greater species packing in the tropics. However, global patterns of diversity within guilds, including trophic guilds (i.e., groups of organisms that use similar food resources), are poorly known. We explored global diversity patterns of a key trophic guild in stream ecosystems, the detritivore shredders. This was motivated by the fundamental ecological role of shredders as decomposers of leaf litter and by some records pointing to low shredder diversity and abundance in the tropics, which contrasts with diversity patterns of most major taxa for which broad-scale latitudinal patterns haven been examined. Given this evidence, we hypothesized that shredders are more abundant and diverse in temperate than in tropical streams, and that this pattern is related to the higher temperatures and lower availability of high-quality leaf litter in the tropics. Our comprehensive global survey (129 stream sites from 14 regions on six continents) corroborated the expected latitudinal pattern and showed that shredder distribution (abundance, diversity and assemblage composition) was explained by a combination of factors, including water temperature (some taxa were restricted to cool waters) and biogeography (some taxa were more diverse in particular biogeographic realms). In contrast to our hypothesis, shredder diversity was unrelated to leaf toughness, but it was inversely related to litter diversity. Our findings markedly contrast with global trends of diversity for most taxa, and with the general rule of higher consumer diversity at higher levels of resource diversity. Moreover, they highlight the emerging role of temperature in understanding global patterns of diversity, which is of great relevance in the face of projected global warming.","Boyero, Luz

Based on the results of our experiments, yolk sac and first-feeding yellowfin larvae exhibited lethal limits for their survival at temperatures less than 21 degrees C and greater than 33 degrees C. Embryos hatched alive at all temperatures tested except 36 degrees C; however, larvae were malformed after hatching at temperatures <20 degrees C and >= 34 degrees C. Egg and larval development were significantly slower at mean incubation temperatures <23 degrees C. Mean egg diameters were significantly greater at mean incubation temperatures <26 degrees C compared with those incubated at temperatures >27 degrees C. Within the temperature range for survival and normal development, mean specific growth rates in weight for larvae after 2 days of feeding maintained at mean temperatures of 21.3 degrees C. 26.6 degrees C, 27.5 degrees C, and 31.5 degrees C were 1.8%, 20.9%, 27.2%, and 45.0%, respectively. The optimal range of temperatures for rapid growth and moderate to high survival in first-feeding larvae was from about 26 to 31 degrees C.
Lethal conditions (100% mortality) for larvae after hatching and shortly after the onset of first feeding occurred at dissolved oxygen concentrations of <22 mg O-2 L-1 (<34% oxygen saturation) at temperatures between 26 and 29 C. Significantly lower survival first occurred for first-feeding larvae when the larvae were exposed to dissolved oxygen concentrations of 2.65 mg O2L-1 (40.4% oxygen saturation). Based on our experimental results, critical depths for survival of yolk-sac and first-feeding yellowfin larvae within the Panama Bight of the Pacific Ocean would occur at depths less than 30 m during the upwelling season and at depths less than 50 m during the reduced upwelling season, based on temperature alone. Limiting oxygen levels may occur at depths greater than 30 m during the upwelling season and greater than 50 m during the reduced upwelling season. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We also described eggs during incubation and the subsequent hatchlings. We collected eggs from nests along streams at Omar Torrijos National Park in central Panama and incubated them until they hatched. We located seven nests (six active, one inactive) containing 47 eggshells (2 depredated; 45 hatched) and 67 unhatched eggs. All nests were on the downstream side of large boulders covered by moss and herbaceous vegetation. Estimated minimum number of females using each nest was one to five. depending on assumptions of the estimate. Estimates in that nesting aggregations were a combination of multiple females nesting communally and repeated deposition of eggs by the same female. Hatchlings averaged 2.66 cm in snout vent length, 4.60 cm in length of tail, and 0.42 g in mass, with no significant difference between males and females or among nests.

"45","Panama_fine.txt","P>The decomposition of plant litter is one of the most important ecosystem processes in the biosphere and is particularly sensitive to climate warming. Aquatic ecosystems are well suited to studying warming effects on decomposition because the otherwise confounding influence of moisture is constant. By using a latitudinal temperature gradient in an unprecedented global experiment in streams, we found that climate warming will likely hasten microbial litter decomposition and produce an equivalent decline in detritivore-mediated decomposition rates. As a result, overall decomposition rates should remain unchanged. Nevertheless, the process would be profoundly altered, because the shift in importance from detritivores to microbes in warm climates would likely increase CO2 production and decrease the generation and sequestration of recalcitrant organic particles. In view of recent estimates showing that inland waters are a significant component of the global carbon cycle, this implies consequences for global biogeochemistry and a possible positive climate feedback.","Boyero, Luz

"46","Panama_fine.txt","Species richness in different groups of microfungi causing disease symptoms on above-ground plant organs is analyzed based on checklists and databases of five tropical regions in the Americas and two regions outside the tropics in North America. In addition, primary data on plant parasitic microfungi collected in natural habitats in western Panama are considered. According to these data, Asterinaceae, Meliolales, Phyllachorales, and rust fungi are highly species rich groups in the Neotropics, while smut fungi appear to be less diverse in the tropics than in extratropical regions. Species of Albuginales, Erysiphales, Peronosporales, and Taphrinales are rarely found in the tropics, and are especially scarce in tropical forests. Morphologically, many tropical plant parasitic microfungi are characterized by melanized walls of fruiting bodies and spores, apparently an adaptation to tropical conditions with strong solar radiation. Gelatinous substances may slow down the process of drying out. The absence of a winter season in the tropics is probably the reason for the lack of spore dormancy and the dominance of asexual developmental stages in the Erysiphales and rust fungi.

"47","Panama_fine.txt","Species distribution models (SDMs) can provide useful information for managing biological invasions, such as identification of priority areas for early detection or for determining containment boundaries. However, prediction of invasive species using SDMs can be challenging because they typically violate the core assumption of being at equilibrium with their environment, which may lead to poorly guided management resulting from high levels of omission. Our goal was to provide a suite of potential decision strategies (DSs) that were not reliant on the equilibrium assumption but rather could be chosen to better match the management application, which in this case was to ensure containment through adequate surveillance. We used presence-only data and expert knowledge for model calibration and presence/absence data to evaluate the potential distribution of an introduced mesquite (Leguminoseae: Prosopis) invasion located in the Pilbara Region of northwest Western Australia. Five different DSs with varying levels of conservatism/risk were derived from a multi-criteria evaluation model using ordered weighted averaging. The performance of DSs over all possible thresholds was examined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. DSs not on the convex hull of the ROC curves were discarded. Two threshold determination methods (TDMs) were compared on the two remaining DSs, one that assumed equilibrium (by maximizing overall prediction success) and another that assumed the invasion was ongoing (using a 95% threshold for true positives). The most conservative DS fitted the validation data most closely but could only predict 75% of the presence data. A more risk-taking DS could predict 95% of the presence data, which identified 8.5 times more area for surveillance, and better highlighted known populations that are still rapidly invading. This DS and TOM coupling was considered to be the most appropriate for our management application. Our results show that predictive niche modeling was highly sensitive to risk levels, but that these can be tailored to match specified management objectives. The methods implemented can be readily adapted to other invasive species or for conservation purposes. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Robinson, Todd P.

"49","Panama_fine.txt","All countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have defined and implemented science, technology and innovation (STI) policies with varying degrees of success within three broad economic models, ""import substitution"", ""liberalization and privatization"", and later in some countries, ""21(st) century socialism"". While STI policies were being adopted and implemented within the three models, the rate of technological change greatly accelerated and changes in the innovation process occurred, passing from a linear to a non-linear model and further evolving into an ""open"" model. Such changes induced a growing complexity in the national innovation systems and present new challenges to STI policy making. The adopted policies permitted significant advances, evidenced by existing indicators; however the LAC region as a whole tags behind other regions. Numerous studies have analyzed this situation and more recently, in the context of an IDRC funded project, the present study surveyed current and former STI leaders for an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness and impact of public STI policies. The responses highlight the achievements and problems that the development of STI faces in LAC. Existing dissatisfaction with the application of the liberalization process and other economic reforms of the 1990's, call for a new development agenda that must include STI to succeed. This requires, in turn, new conditions and rules for governance, in particular policy making, so that STI are stimulated and guided by the search for solutions to existing social and economic challenges considering the growing complexity of innovation systems.","Aguirre-Bastos, Carlos

"52","Panama_fine.txt","Soil water and temperature regimes in the tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, were simulated directly from meteorological data using the model SWEAT. Separate field observations from root-exclusion, litter-removal and control treatments in one small and one large forest gap were used for calibration and validation. After irrigating all treatments to field capacity, soil matric potential and temperature were measured over 17 days at four depths <50 mm using the filter-paper technique and bead thermistors. Under-Storey environments were also simulated under the same initial conditions. The results suggest that three distinct scenarios, controlled by gap size, describe how the above- and below-ground processes controlling soil drying are coupled: (1) in the large gap, root water extraction by surrounding trees is negligible so soil drying is dominated by evaporation from the soil surface. Soil temperature is dominated by direct solar heating and cooling due to evaporation. (2) In the small gap, root water extraction dominates soil drying with soil evaporation playing a minor role. Soil temperature is still dominated by direct sunlight with some cooling due to evaporation. (3) In the understorey, root water extraction dominates soil drying. Soil temperature is dominated by heat conduction from deep soil layers with some evaporation and sensible heat transfer. The contrasting soil drying regimes imposed by variation in canopy structure enhance micro-environmental heterogeneity and the scope for differential germination and seedling establishment in coexisting tropical tree species.

"53","Panama_fine.txt","This paper examines the application of the Incremental Cost (IC) principle for the conservation of globally important habitats. It first describes the characteristics of the IC and how it became an important financial modality in multilateral conservation efforts. The application of the IC is then examined taking into account characteristics of successful collaboration efforts for the global environment. The paper finds that as currently applied, the IC fails to be a robust financial mechanism for protection of globally important habitats. It also heavily skews the bulk of conservation costs from developed to developing countries. The paper concludes with a description of suggested changes to make the IC an effective tool in global conservation efforts. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"54","Panama_fine.txt","Habitat fragmentation and diversity loss due to increased conversion of natural habitats to agricultural uses influence the distribution and abundance of wildlife species and thus may change the ecology of pathogen transmission. We used hantaviruses in Panama as a research model to determine whether anthropogenic environmental change is associated with changes in the dynamics of viral transmission. Specifically, we wanted to determine whether hantavirus infection was correlated with spatial attributes of the landscape at both large and small scales or whether these changes are mediated by changes in community composition. When analyzed at coarse spatial scales, hantavirus reservoirs were more commonly found in disturbed habitats and edge habitats than in forested areas. At local scales, reservoir species dominance was significantly correlated with the slope of the terrain. To evaluate the effect of small-mammal diversity loss on infection dynamics, we implemented an experiment with selective species removal at experimental sites. Seroprevalence of hantavirus was higher in the community of small mammals and increased through time in the experimental sites. The higher seroprevalence in experimental plots suggests that greater diversity likely reduces encounter rates between infected and susceptible hosts. Our studies suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation and species diversity loss are altering hantavirus infection dynamics in Panama. Our work represents a multidisciplinary approach toward disease research that includes biodiversity concerns such as environmental change and degradation, human settlement patterns, and the ecology of host and nonhost species, work that may be especially important in tropical countries.","Suzan, Gerardo

"56","Panama_fine.txt","Small populations are vulnerable to long-term declines, even where short-term censuses indicate increasing trends in numbers. Census data for the Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus) collected between 1970 and 2004 provide evidence that despite year-to-year population increases detected in most of the annual censuses, the strong El Nino events of 1982-83 and 1997-98 were followed by population declines of more than 60% from which the species has yet to recover. Such large declines raise concerns about the future viability of the species because the frequency and severity of El Nino events are predicted to increase. We used the simulation software VORTEX to evaluate the potential effects of El Nino on the risk of extinction of the Galapagos penguin population and its four constituent subpopulations. Weak and strong El Nino events were treated as catastrophes, with varying frequencies, which simulated past, current and future effects on the penguin population. The ""Current El Nino"" scenario, based on the frequency of El Nino events recorded in the Galapagos between 1965 and 2004, indicated an approximately 30% probability of extinction within the next 100 years for the penguin population. More ominously, the species may be at a greater risk if the frequency of strong El Nino episodes increases only marginally. A probability of extinction greater than 80% was predicted when the current frequency (5%) of strong El Nino events was doubled (to 10%). The probabilities of extinctions were higher for each subpopulation treated individually, ranging from 34% for Isabela and Fernandina, 64% for Bartolome-Santiago to 78% for the smallest subpopulation on Floreana. Sensitivity analyses identified survival of penguins during El Nino events and sex ratio as influential parameters. The estimates of extinction risk may be conservative as other threats associated. with increased human activities on the islands may further compromise species persistence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although most isotopic research has been concentrated in temperate Zones, there has been an increase in isotopic studies in the tropics in recent years that have led to the understanding of detailed processes in complex ecosystems. This review highlights studies that use isotopic composition of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen to study biogeochemical processes in tropical environments from molecular up to regional scales. By describing the current state of knowledge in isotopic studies in the tropics, it is hoped to stimulate more research in this area. Based on the spectacular results obtained from the use of isotopes in tropical biology, there is confidence that isotopes will lead to exciting advances in the future.","Santiago, LS

"60","Panama_fine.txt","This article reports on domestication as a simple way to promote plant conservation in indigenous villages. We developed simple methods to germinate or transplant palm species central to the traditional livelihood of two Panamanian nations: the Embera and the Wounaan. The target species were Astrocaryum standleyanum, Sabal mauritiiformis and Socratea exorrhiza. The youngest fully expanded leaf of Astrocaryum provides prime material for weaving baskets that are a major source of income for the Embera and Wounaan communities of Panama. Sabal and Socratea are the two most important species for traditional architecture. They provide, respectively, the roofs and floor of the round, open-sided Embera-Wounaan houses. For each of the three target species, different treatments were tested to obtain germination rates as high as possible. Regardless of the treatments to which seeds were subjected, germination of Astrocaryum was difficult and slow. It took 13 months to break dormancy and the germination success was around 40%. However, the two other species, especially Socratea, were easy to germinate. Our project succeeded in introducing the practice of nursery and cultivation in over 20 indigenous villages of Panama. It is hoped that such forestry approaches to conservation can help protect important components of biodiversity while giving access to the resource to people whose lifestyle depends on them.","Potvin, C

As aquaculture is one source of this problem, this paper reviews the role of some governments and international organizations in the development of this activity. We conclude that these organizations should reconsider the use of technical packages that encourage introduction of exotic species. Instead, they should help the development of technologies that propose to cultivate native species with potential for aquaculture. This will require research to determine optimal conditions for culture, and it will improve local research capacities. International technical funding agencies can exert a great influence in encouraging new practices.","Perez, JE

"64","Panama_fine.txt","Predation is an important selective pressure in natural ecosystems. Among non-human primates, relatively little is known about how predators hunt primate prey and how primates acquire adaptive responses to counteract predation. In this study we took advantage of the recent reintroduction of radio-tagged harpy eagles (Harpia harpyja) to Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama to explore how mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata), one of their primary prey, acquire anti-predator defences. Based on the observation that harpies follow their prey prior to attack, and often call during this pursuit period, we broadcast harpy eagle calls to howlers on BCI as well as to a nearby control population with no harpy predation. Although harpies have been extinct from this area for 50-100 years, results indicate that BCI howlers rapidly acquired an adaptive anti-predator response to harpy calls, while showing no response to other avian vocalizations; howlers maintained this response several months after the removal of the eagles. These results not only show that non-human primates can rapidly acquire an alarm response to a newly introduced predator, but that they can detect and identify predators on the basis of acoustic cues alone. These findings have significant implications both for the role of learning mechanisms in the evolution of prey defence and for conservation strategies, suggesting that the use of 'probing' approaches, such as auditory playbacks, may highly enhance an a priori assessment of the impact of species reintroduction.","Gil-da-Costa, R

The average poaching rate across all studies was 30% of all nests observed. Thirteen studies reported poaching rates of greater than or equal to 20%, and four reported rates of >70%. Only six studies documented no nest poaching. Of these, four were conducted on islands in the Caribbean region, which had significantly lower poaching rates than the mainland Neotropics. The other two studies that showed no poaching were conducted on the two species with the lowest economic value in our sample (U.S. retail price). In four studies that allowed direct comparison between poaching at sites with active nest protection versus that at unprotected sites poaching rates were significantly lower at protected sites, suggesting that active protection efforts can be effective in reducing nest poaching. In those studies conducted both before and after the passage of the U.S. Wild Bird Conservation Act, Poaching rates were found to be significantly lower following its enactment than in the period before. This result supports the hypothesis that the legal and illegal parrot trades are positively related, rather than inversely related as has been suggested by avicultural interests. Overall, our study indicates that poaching of parrot nestlings for economic gain is a widespread and biologically significant source of nest mortality in Neotropical parrots.","Wright, TF

"66","Panama_fine.txt","1. The thermoregulatory capabilities of 18 species of Alaskan bees spanning nearly two orders of magnitude of body mass were measured. Thoracic temperature, measured across the temperature range at which each species forages, was regressed against operative (environmental) temperature to determine bees' abilities to maintain relatively constant thoracic temperatures across a range of operative temperatures (thermoregulatory performance).
2. Previous studies on insect thermoregulation have compared thoracic temperature with ambient air temperature. Operative temperature, which integrates air temperature, solar radiation and effects of wind, was estimated by measuring the temperature of a fresh, dead bee in the field environment. It is suggested that this is a more accurate measure of the thermal environment experienced by the insect and also allows direct comparisons of insects under different microclimate conditions, such as in sun and shade.
3. Simple regression analysis of species and family means, and analysis of phylogenetically based independent contrasts showed thermoregulatory capability, ability to elevate thoracic temperature, and minimum thoracic temperature necessary for initiating flight all increased with body size.
4. Bumble-bees were better thermoregulators than solitary bees primarily as a consequence of their larger body size. However, their thermoregulatory abilities were slightly, but significantly, better than predicted from body size alone, suggesting an added role of pelage and/or physiology. Large solitary bees were better thermoregulators than small solitary bees apparently as a result of body-size differences, with small bees acting as thermal conformers.","Bishop, JA

"67","Panama_fine.txt","We evaluate a three-parr hypothesis explaining why gall-inducing insect species richness is so high in scleromorphic vegetation: (1) persistence of low nutrient status scleromorphic leaves facilitates the galling habit in warm temperate latitudes; (2) favourable colonization sites for gallers result from reduced hygrothermal stress, high phenolics in the outer cortex of the gall, and reduced carnivore and fungal attack in the gall, and (3) in more mesic sires, mortality is high due to carnivore attack and invasion of galls by fungi, Over 280 samples of local species of galling herbivorous insects from fourteen countries on all continents except Antarctica revealed a strong pattern of highest richness in warm temperate latitudes, or their altitudinal equivalents. The peak of galling species richness on the latitudinal gradient from the equator into the Arctic was between 25 to 38 degrees N or S, Galling species were particularly diverse in sclerophyllous vegetation, which commonly had greater than twelve species per local sample. In mesic, non-sclerophyllous vegetation types the number of galling species was lower with twelve or fewer species present. Many sites in sclerophyllous vegetation supported between thirteen and forty-six galling species locally, including campina islands in Amazonia, cerrado savanna in central Brazil, the Sonoran Desert in Arizona and Mexico, shrubland in Israel, fynbos in South Africa and coastal scleromorphic vegetation in Australia. At the same latitude, or its elevational equivalent, galling species richness was significantly higher in relatively xeric sites when compared to riparian or otherwise mesic habitats, even when scleromorphic vegetation dominated the mesic sites. The results were consistent with the hypothesis and extend to a more general level the patterns and predictions on the biogeography of gall-inducing insects.","Price, PW

"69","Panama_fine.txt","With the purpose of establishing the serum lipid and lipoprotein range of values in a sample of urban Panamenian population, serum triglycerides, cholesterol and cholesterol - HDL concentrations were determined by colorimetric - enzymatic methods.
The sample population, with normal blood pressure and asymptomatic studied was 717 individuals; 57% males and 42.7% females.
Cholesterol bound to VLDL and to LDL were calculated; and also the ratio CT/C-HDL, predictor of atherogenic risk.
Serum values of triglycerides and cholesterol showed an increase in percentage from one decade to the next; the same happened with the values of cholesterol bound to VLDL and to LDL; the C-HDL values varied very little from one group of age to the other and showed a high frequency of low values.
We show concern about the prevalence of the above mentioned serum values in virtue of the morbidity and the mortality rates of cardiac heart disease and cerebral vascular disease in Panamenian populations.","FERGUSON, E
