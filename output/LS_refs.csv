"1","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Mesoamerican amphibian declines in apparently pristine and protected habitats have been severe, especially at elevations above 500 m sea level and have been linked to emerging diseases and a changing climate. The Craugastor punctariolus species series of direct developing frogs is endemic to the region and used to be comprised of 33 species, seven of which have known populations at present. One of these, C. ranoides, endemic to southern Nicaragua and Costa Rica, was historically found in cloud forest sites of area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG) in north-west Costa Rica and extended into dry forest sites 20 km distant. Here, C. ranoides declined and disappeared from high elevation sites between the mid-1980s and early 1990s, but populations persisted in the lowland dry forest. We compared the genetic richness and ranavirus infection status of C. ranoides from extant dry forest populations to historic museum specimens of now extinct ACG cloud forest populations using DNA sequence diversity at two mitochondrial loci and molecular screening for ranavirus. Extant dry forest populations of C. ranoides formed a monophyletic group which included historic specimens sampled at cloud forest sites. However, the extirpated ACG cloud forest population contained additional diversity: samples formed a divergent clade with unknown spatial distribution. Ranavirus was detected in both current and museum samples of C. ranoides and sequences from a 267-nucleotide region of the major capsid protein gene shared 100% sequence identity with one another and with Frog virus 3. Our findings document cryptic diversity within an endangered species that has demonstrated no recovery in cloud forests and raises questions about Ranavirus and its potential link to the amphibian declines in this system. The presence of the same C. ranoides clade within present day and historical samples suggests a potential for effective translocation and repopulation of extirpated cloud forest populations.","Puschendorf, R.

Herbs, shrubs, understory trees, and saplings of canopy trees occupy a broadly uniform environment of abundant rainfall, low light levels, and high humidity. We asked whether this community at the La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica was structured by environmental filters such as soil origin, topographic position, and understory light availability. We used nested quadrats to assess effects of soil origin (recent alluvium, weathered alluvium, residual volcanic soil) and topographic position (ridges, mid-slopes and flats) on species composition, density, and diversity and measured six edaphic and understory light parameters. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations were based on frequency of occurrence in 20 quadrats for 272 species in the shrub size class and 136 species in the small-tree size class for 17 sites. Three axes were correlated with composite environmental variables produced by principal component analysis representing slope, extractable phosphorus, and light. NMS site positions also reflected soil origin, topographic position, and geographic location. The analyses illustrated a complex community structured by species responses to environmental filters at multiple, interdigitated spatial scales. We suggest that light availability affected by canopy dynamics and dispersal limitation provides additional sources of variation in species distributions, which interact with edaphic patterns in complex ways. in Spanish is available with online material.","Denslow, Julie S.

An objective statistical analysis demonstrated that the WorldView-3 imagery, after applying a series of spectral and illumination image corrections, was able to accurately identify selected tree species. Specifically, this study defines the image bands and image-derived spectral vegetation indices that are the most effective for tree species discrimination. We show that corrected absolute reflectivity values from the green, red, red edge, and near-infrared are good differentiators of tropical tree species crowns. We also evaluate 14 possible multiband vegetation indices and show that two new indices developed here, using WorldView-3 image bands, have the highest discriminatory power for tropical tree species.

"5","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Global atmospheric methane growth rates have wildly fluctuated over the past three decades, which may be driven by the proportion of tropical land surface saturated by water. The El Nino/Southern Oscillation Event (ENSO) cycle drives large-scale climatic trends globally, with El Nino events typically bringing drier weather than La Nina. In a lowland tropical wet forest in Costa Rica, we measured methane flux bimonthly from March 2016 to June 2017 and using an automated chamber system. We observed a strong drying trend for several weeks during the El Nino in 2016, reducing soil moisture below normal levels. In contrast, soil conditions had high water content prior to the drought and during the moderate La Nina that followed. Soil moisture varied across the period studied and significantly impacted methane flux. Methane consumption was greater during the driest part of the El Nino period, while during La Nina and other time periods, soils had lower methane consumption. The mean methane flux observed was -0.022 mg CH4-C m(-2) hr(-1), and methane was consumed at all timepoints, with lower consumption in saturated soils. Our data show that month studied, and the correlation between soil type and month significantly drove methane flux trends. Our data indicate that ENSO cycles may impact biogenic methane fluxes, mediated by soil moisture conditions. Climate projections for Central America show dryer conditions and increased El Nino frequency, further exacerbating predicted drought. These trends may lead to negative climate feedbacks, with drier conditions increasing soil methane consumption from the atmosphere.","Aronson, E. L.

This study examined whether three species of short-tailed fruit bat that co-occur at a lowland tropical forest site in Costa Rica (Carollia castanea, C. perspicillata, C. sowelli) avoid inter- and intraspecific competition through dietary specialization on species in the genus Piper. First, dietary composition was examined using faecal samples (N = 210), which yielded three main findings: (1) bat species and sexes vary in overall reliance on fruits of Piper, with a higher percentage of seeds of Piper detected in the diets of C. castanea (98.2%) and females (91.5%); (2) adults and juveniles partition species of Piper by habitat, with a lower percentage of mid- to late-successional species of Piper detected in adults (20.8%); and (3) overall, there is a strong dietary overlap among and within the three species of Carollia. Second, controlled choice experiments were conducted with individual bats (N = 123) to examine preferences for different species of Piper. These results indicated few differences in Piper preference based on bat species, sex, age class or reproductive status, suggesting preference is not the primary mechanism shaping the observed differences in dietary composition. Overall, the dietary composition and preference similarities suggest there is strong competition both among and within the three species of Carollia for food resources.","Maynard, Lauren D.

Significantly higher concentrations of CUPs were observed around LS, while LC had a higher concentration of OCPs. Land use analysis indicated that LS had a higher fraction of agriculture than LC (33% vs 14%), suggesting the higher CUPs concentration at LS was related to pesticide intensive crops, while higher OCPs concentration at LC may be attributed to the area's long agricultural history characterized by small-scale subsistence farming or long-range transport. In Uganda, CUPs and OCPs were generally lower than in Costa Rica, but high concentrations of HFRs were observed inside KNP, possibly due to human activity at research camps near the protected forest.

The aim of this study is to establish an accurate classification procedure for tropical tree species, specifically testing the feasibility of WorldView-3 (WV-3) multispectral imagery for this task. The specific study site is a defined arboretum within a well-known tropical forest research location in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station). An object-based classification is the basis for the analysis to classify six selected tree species. A combination of pre-processed WV-3 bands were inputs to the classification, and an edge segmentation process defined multi-pixel-scale tree canopies. WorldView-3 bands in the Green, Red, Red Edge, and Near-Infrared 2, particularly when incorporated in two specialized vegetation indices, provide high discrimination among the selected species. Classification results yield an accuracy of 85.37%, with minimal errors of commission (7.89%) and omission (14.63%). Shadowing in the satellite imagery had a significant effect on segmentation accuracy (identifying single-species canopy tops) and on classification. The methodology presented provides a path to better characterization of tropical forest species distribution and overall composition for improving biomass studies in a tropical environment.","Cross, Matthew

"9","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Tropical understory birds have declined due largely to habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we revisited a study conducted three decades ago and used artificial nests to examine depredation rates in a Costa Rican biological corridor. Using camera trap data, we compared potential nest predator detection rates at experimental tinamou ground nests in La Selva Biological Station and at sites in five local forest fragments. Nest predator detections were positively associated with landscape-scale core forest and distance away from forest edge, as well as with local-scale human trails, and negatively associated with primary forest compared to secondary growth. Twenty-two of 52 artificial nests were depredated, which was similar to previous research in the area. Mammalian and avian predators were common nest predators, but unknown predators (presumably snakes) were responsible for half of nests lost. Nests within La Selva core forest had lower probability of nest loss compared to fragments despite exhibiting higher predator detection rates. Yet other fragmentation covariates such as distance from forest edge, nest occurrence on human trails, or forest age were not associated with nest loss. We suggest that concentrated foraging is the underlying mechanism behind the community interactions that we observed. Community members exist in concentrated use areas within forest fragments, which results in heightened predator foraging rates and thus stronger interactions in fragments despite more predators encountering the nests in core forest. Fragmentation is a global phenomenon and we suspect that concentrated community use of limited resources is driving species to interact more strongly than in natural ecosystems.","Fernandez, Christopher M.

Widely distributed, they occur throughout Central and South America, the West Indies, and the southeastern United States. Although anoles have emerged as paradigmatic species in ecology and evolution, relatively little research has addressed the effects of climate change on their distributions. Over the past 40 years, Puerto Rico has experienced steady increases in ambient temperature with mean maximum temperatures rising by as much as 2 degrees C. Using distribution data from the Puerto Rico Gap Analysis, WorldClim bioclimatic variables, and MaxEnt niche modeling software, we projected potential changes in the distribution of ten species of Puerto Rican anoles for 2050 and 2070. All of our models used either the HadGEM2-AO or the MRI-CGCM3 Global Climate Model, each paired with the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCP4.5 was chosen as it represents a scenario in which greenhouse gas concentrations rise in the Earth's atmosphere until the year 2040 and then begin to decline. RCP8.5 was chosen as it represents a likely scenario of continued high greenhouse gas emissions through 2100 and acts as the IPCC's worst-case scenario of warming. Under HadGEM2-AO RCP8.5 for 2050, Anolis krugi, A. evermanni, and A. gundlachi are the most negatively impacted species, while for MRI-CGCM3 RCP8.5 for 2050, the most negatively impacted species are A. cuvieri, A. gundlachi, and A. evermanni. The models also predict mean reductions in most suitable habitat across all ten species of Analis, ranging from -29.4% by 2050 to -39.6% by 2070 under HadGEM2-AO RCP8.5, and from -10.6% by 2050 to -28.5% by 2070 under MRI-CGCM3 RCP8.5. Our study provides insights into the potential impact of continued climate change on Puerto Rican anoles, and most likely other West Indian species of Anolis, and has important implications for future conservation efforts.","Thonis, Anna E.

We used a 7-year (2007-2013) capture-mark-recapture dataset from an exceptionally wet premontane forest at mid-elevation in Costa Rica to estimate apparent survival for seven species of tropical passerines. For four of these species, we provide the first published demographic parameters. Recapture probabilities ranged from 0.21 to 0.53, and annual estimates of apparent survival varied from 0.23 to 1.00. We also assessed the consequences of inter-annual variation in rainfall on demographic rates. Our results are consistent with inter-annual rainfall increasing estimates of apparent survival for two species and decreasing estimates for three species. For the three species where we could compare our estimates of apparent survival to estimates from drier regions, our estimates were not consistently higher or lower than those published previously. The temporal and spatial variability in demographic rates we document within and among species highlights the difficulties of generalizing life history characteristics across broad biogeographic gradients. Most importantly, this work emphasizes the context-specific role of precipitation in shaping tropical avian demographic rates and underscores the need for mechanistic studies of environmental drivers of tropical life histories.","Shogren, Elsie H.

"13","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Army ants are among the top arthropod predators and considered keystone species in tropical ecosystems. During daily mass raids with many thousand workers, army ants hunt live prey, likely exerting strong top-down control on prey species. Many tropical sites exhibit a high army ant species diversity (>20 species), suggesting that sympatric species partition the available prey niches. However, whether and to what extent this is achieved has not been intensively studied yet. We therefore conducted a large-scale diet survey of a community of surface-raiding army ants at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. We systematically collected 3,262 prey items from eleven army ant species (genera Eciton, Nomamyrmex and Neivamyrmex). Prey items were classified as ant prey or non-ant prey. The prey nearly exclusively consisted of other ants (98%), and most booty was ant brood (87%). Using morphological characters and DNA barcoding, we identified a total of 1,103 ant prey specimens to the species level. One hundred twenty-nine ant species were detected among the army ant prey, representing about 30% of the known local ant diversity. Using weighted bipartite network analyses, we show that prey specialization in army ants is unexpectedly high and prey niche overlap very small. Besides food niche differentiation, we uncovered a spatiotemporal niche differentiation in army ant raid activity. We discuss competition-driven multidimensional niche differentiation and predator-prey arms races as possible mechanisms underlying prey specialization in army ants. By combining systematic prey sampling with species-level prey identification and network analyses, our integrative approach can guide future research by portraying how predator-prey interactions in complex communities can be reliably studied, even in cases where morphological prey identification is infeasible.","Hoenle, Philipp O.

Using measurements from airborne lidar in a lowland Neotropical rain forest, we quantify vertical leaf-area profiles and develop models of ANPP driven by leaf area and other measurements of forest structure. Vertical leaf-area profiles predict 38% of the variation among plots. This number is 4.5 times greater than models using total leaf area (disregarding vertical arrangement) and 2.1 times greater than models using canopy height alone. Furthermore, ANPP predictions from vertical leaf-area profiles were less biased than alternate metrics. Variation in ANPP not attributable to temperature or precipitation can be predicted by the vertical distribution of leaf area in this system.","Cushman, K. C.

"15","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In tropical forest communities, seedling recruitment can be limited by the number of fruit produced by adults. Fruit production tends to be highly unequal among trees of the same species, which may be due to environmental factors. We observed fruit production for similar to 2,000 trees of 17 species across 3years in a wet tropical forest in Costa Rica. Fruit production was modeled as a function of tree size, nutrient availability, and neighborhood crowding. Following model selection, tree size and neighborhood crowding predicted both the probability of reproduction and the number of fruit produced. Nutrient availability only predicted only the probability of reproduction. In all species, larger trees were more likely to be reproductive and produce more fruit. In addition, number of fruit was strongly negatively related to presence of larger neighboring trees in 13 species; presence of all neighboring trees had a weak-to-moderate negative influence on reproductive status in 16 species. Among various metrics of soil nutrient availability, only sum of base cations was positively associated with reproductive status, and for only four species. Synthesis Overall, these results suggest that direct influences on fruit production tend to be mediated through tree size and crowding from neighboring trees, rather than soil nutrients. However, we found variation in the effects of neighbors and nutrients among species; mechanistic studies of allocation to fruit production are needed to explain these differences.","Minor, David M.

We studied how leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes impacts soil CO2 dynamics in a wet Neotropical forest. We measured soil CO2 concentration monthly over 2.5years at multiple depths in nonnest and nest soils (some of which were abandoned during the study) and assessed CO2 production. We also measured nest and nonnest soil efflux, nest vent efflux, and vent concentration. Nest soils exhibited lower CO2 accumulation than nonnest soils for the same precipitation amounts. During wet periods, soil CO2 concentrations increased across all depths, but were significantly less in nest than in nonnest soils. Differences were nonsignificant during drier periods. Surface efflux was equal across nest and nonnest plots (5mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), while vent efflux was substantially (10(3) to 10(5) times) greater, a finding attributed to free convection and sporadic forced convection. Vent CO2 concentrations were less than in soil, suggesting CO2 efflux from the soil matrix into the nest. Legacy effects in abandoned nests were still observable after more than two years. These findings indicate that leaf-cutter ant nests provide alternative transport pathways to soil CO2 that increase total emissions and decrease soil CO2 concentrations, and have a lasting impact. Estimated total nest-soil CO2 emissions were 15 to 60% more than in nonnest soils, contributing 0.2 to 0.7% to ecosystem-scale soil emissions. The observed CO2 dynamics illuminate the significant carbon footprint of ecosystem engineer Atta cephalotes and have biogeochemical implications for rainforest ecosystems.
Plain Language Summary Leaf-cutter ants modify their habitat to the extent that they are called ecosystem engineers. Living throughout the Americas, they construct massive nests to which they import the vegetation they harvest to feed a fungus they cultivate as their main food source. We studied the most common leaf-cutter ant in Costa Rica to assess the impact of its nests on carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in surrounding soils and on soil CO2 emissions. In the Costa Rican rainforest, heavy rains easily clog the clayey soils, accumulating CO2 from microbial and root respiration. During wet periods, we observed lower CO2 concentrations in nest soils relative to nonnest soils. We attribute this difference to the nest structure, which provides ventilation for both nest CO2 and the CO2 originated in the surrounding soil. We also found that soil CO2 emissions were the same in nest and nonnest soils, but nest openings had emissions 100,000 times greater. Consequently, nests and their surrounding soils emit 15 to 60% more CO2 than the equivalent nonnest soil areas. This difference, together with the expanding range of leaf-cutter ants, favored by human activities and warmer climate, has implications with respect to the global carbon cycle.","Fernandez-Bou, A.

Females of this species demonstrate a preference for local over non-local males, although the contribution of different communication modes to mate choice remains untested. We performed eight sets of experiments at La Selva Biological Station (Costa Rica) to test the relative roles of male advertisement call and flank-stripe pattern on female mate choice. For each trial, we used pre-recorded calls for acoustic signals and/or 3D-printed, hand-painted models for visual stimulus. Females selected conspecifics over heterospecifics when presented with either acoustic or visual stimuli only, indicating that both evolve as species-specific signals used for mate discrimination. Bayesian modeling showed that females chose local males over non-locals based on unimodal; responses to multimodal signals varied. Female mate choice in this species is likely nuanced and subject to the constraints of the local environment in which animals are signaling. Our data show that at least two traits that vary among populations are important for mate selection.Significance statementEvolution shapes animal communication in diverse ways to accommodate complicated signaling contexts, including environmental noise, the presence of eavesdroppers, and changing landscapes. Among species that use complex signals or signals in multiple modalities, understanding the role of signaling traits in reproductive behavior and their concomitant shifts between populations can shed light on lineage divergence, speciation, and the forces shaping communication. We used choice tests with Agalychnis callidryas to determine which traits lead to local-male mate preference. We found that both call and stripe are each sufficient to allow this nocturnal frog to choose mates in absence of the other stimulus. Multimodal signals were marginally better than callbut not coloralone. This may be a result of statistical noise or preliminary evidence of asymmetric use of traits across a complex landscape. These results suggest that call and color may encode both redundant information and multiple messages to receivers in this species: either is sufficient to elicit mate choice (redundant), but together, they enhance local mate preference (multiple messages). Further tests on how other communication modalities inform behavior will add to our understanding of complex signaling and lineage divergence among differentiated populations in this species.","Kaiser, Kristine

Herbivore diet breadth is an important factor mediating these tri-trophic interactions, as specialisation can influence how herbivore fitness is affected by plant traits. We investigated how phytochemistry, herbivore immunity, and herbivore diet breadth mediate plantcaterpillar-parasitoid interactions on the tropical plant genus Piper (Piperaceae) at La Selva Biological station in Costa Rica and at Yanayacu Biological Station in Ecuador. We collected larval stages of one Piper generalist species, Quadrus cerealis, (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) and 4 specialist species in the genus Eois (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) from 15 different species of Piper, reared them on host leaf material, and assayed phenoloxidase activity as a measure of potential larval immunity. We combined these data with parasitism and caterpillar species diet breadth calculated from a 19-year database, as well as established values of phytochemical diversity calculated for each plant species, in order to test specific hypotheses about how these variables are related. We found that phytochemical diversity was an important predictor for herbivore immunity, herbivore parasitism, and diet breadth for specialist caterpillars, but that the direction and magnitude of these relationships differed between sites. In Costa Rica, specialist herbivore immune function was negatively associated with the phytochemical diversity of the Piper host plants, and rates of parasitism decreased with higher immune function. The same was true for Ecuador with the exception that there was a positive association between immune function and phytochemical diversity. Furthermore, phytochemical diversity did not affect herbivore immunity and parasitism for the more generalised herbivore. Results also indicated that small differences in herbivore diet breadth are an important factor mediating herbivore immunity and parasitism success for Eois at both sites. These patterns contribute to a growing body of literature that demonstrate strong cascading effects of phytochemistry on higher trophic levels that are dependent on herbivore specialisation and that can vary in space and time. Investigating the interface between herbivore immunity, plant chemical defence, and parasitoids is an important facet of tri-trophic interactions that can help to explain the enormous amount of biodiversity found in the tropics.","Slinn, Heather L.

Approximately 22 species of bats are able to modify leaves to establish their roost, 17 of which are in the Neotropics. Although there are many studies of tent-roosting bats, this is the first describing the structure of the interaction between bats and the plants they are using as roosts. We describe a potential antagonistic network between these bats and the plants used for tent construction in La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. We calculated descriptors of the network such as the number of bats and plants interacting, as well as the number of pairwise interactions based on published records or direct observations. We also tested for connectance and nestedness in the network structure. We propose a name for this non-trophic antagonistic interaction, which is a structural antagonism, where bats damage the leaves, reducing their lifespan and the plant fitness. In La Selva the network is composed of eight bats and 45 plant species reported by 60 pairwise interactions. Only 2.16% of vascular plant species in La Selva are being modified as tents. The network had low connectance (0.167) and no significant nestedness or modularity. Considering the species richness of plants in La Selva, there are few links between tent-roosting bats and plants species, which shows the specialization of these interactions and the high dependence of most of these bats on a few plant species, even if they are very specific and temporary resources.","Rodriguez-Herrera, Bernal

Although soil pH influences dispersivity, it is usually relatively constant within a site, and thus not considered a driver of aggregation dynamics. However, land-use change that results in shifts in tree-species composition can result in alteration of soil pH, owing to species-specific traits, e.g., support of nitrogen fixation and Al accumulation. In a long-term, randomized complete block experiment in which climate, soil type, and previous land-use history were similar, we evaluated effects of individual native tropical tree species on water-stable macroaggregate size distributions in an Oxisol. We conducted this study at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, in six vegetation types: 25-year-old plantations of four tree species grown in monodominant stands; an unplanted Control; and an adjacent mature forest. Tree species significantly influenced aggregate proportions in smaller size classes (0.25-1.0 mm), which were correlated with fine-root growth and litterfall. Tree species altered soil pH differentially. Across all vegetation types, the proportion of smaller macroaggregates declined significantly as soil pH increased (p <= 0.0184). This suggests that alteration of pH influences dispersivity, and thus macroaggregate dynamics, thereby playing a role in soil C, N, and P cycling.","Russell, Ann E.

Army ants and their arthropod guests represent a fascinating example of species-rich host-symbiont associations where host specificity ranges across the entire generalist -specialist continuum. In the present study, we compared the behavioral and chemical integration mechanisms of two extremes of the generalist -specialist continuum: generalist ant-predators in the genus Tetradonia (Staphylinidae: Aleocharinae: Athetini), and specialist ant-mimics in the genera Ecitomorpha and Ecitophya (Staphylinidae: Aleocharinae: Ecitocharini). Similar to a previous study of Tetradonia beetles, we combined DNA barcoding with morphological studies to define species boundaries in ant-mimicking beetles. This approach found four ant-mimicking species at our study site at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Community sampling of Eciton army ant parasites revealed that ant-mimicking beetles were perfect host specialists, each beetle species being associated with a single Eciton species. These specialists were seamlessly integrated into the host colony, while generalists avoided physical contact to host ants in behavioral assays. Analysis of the ants' nestmate recognition cues, i.e. cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), showed close similarity in CHC composition and CHC concentration between specialists and Eciton burchellii foreli host ants. On the contrary, the chemical profiles of generalists matched host profiles less well, indicating that high accuracy in chemical host resemblance is only accomplished by socially integrated species. Considering the interplay between behavior, morphology, and cuticular chemistry, specialists but not generalists have cracked the ants' social code with respect to various sensory modalities. Our results support the long-standing idea that the evolution of host-specialization in parasites is a trade-off between the range of potential host species and the level of specialization on any particular host.","von Beeren, Christoph

One example is Sclerorhabditis neotropicalis that inhabit the nests of Azteca ants in Cecropia trees. The goal of the present study is to increase our knowledge about these organisms and their possible symbiotic relationship with the ants and their host plant. The samples were collected during 2011-2013 in different locations in Costa Rica: Parque Nacional Carara (Puntarenas province), San Pedro de Montes de Oca and Highway 27 (San Jose) and La Selva Biological Station (Sarapiqui, Heredia). We examined 576 internodes from 23 plants, comprising four species of Cecropia (including one non-myrmecophyte) and five Azteca species. S. neotropicalis was found in all but one of the Azteca/Cecropia combinations examined. Queen and worker ants were placed in water in order to dislodge nematodes and the results were largely positive, suggesting that alate queens carry S. neotropicalis between trees and that workers carry them between internodes. In addition to transport, preliminary observations suggest that the ants provide masses of scraped parenchyma (possibly fertilized with feces) as a substrate for bacteria upon which the nematodes presumably feed. We also found S. neotropicalis associated with Azteca in another myrmecophyte, Cordia alliodora, suggesting that this ant/nematode association is not restricted to Cecropia. SEM photographs of S. neotropicalis were provided to supplement the original description of this species, and molecular phylogenetic analyses employing three different markers suggest that Sclerorhabditis forms a well-supported clade of bacteria-feeding nematodes associated with Azteca. Indirect evidence suggests that this is a mutualistic association, but the benefits to the ants remain unknown.","Morera, Jessica

Here, we measured glass frog community assembly across a gradient of riparian habitats from first- to fifth-order streams at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We performed repeated nocturnal frog calling surveys and built occupancy and N-mixture abundance models to test for varying patterns of species occupancy, community assembly, species richness (alpha-diversity) and species turnover (beta-diversity). We observed significant differences in patterns of species occupancy and community assembly across a stream-order gradient: occupancy of two species increased with stream order (Teratohyla pulverata, Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni), one species decreased (Teratohyla spinosa), and one species did not vary (Espadarana prosoblepon). We evaluated four a priori hypotheses describing how alpha- and beta-diversity of centrolenids are shaped across the riparian gradient; our data were most consistent with a pattern of nested assemblages and increasing species richness along the riparian gradient.

Poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are aposematic, territorial, and visually orientedthree characteristics which make dendrobatids an appropriate model to test for conspecific attraction. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using an extensive mark-recapture dataset of the strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio) from La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Data were collected from replicate populations in a relatively homogenous Theobroma cacao plantation, which provided a unique opportunity to test how conspecifics influence the spatial ecology of migrants in a controlled habitat with homogenous structure. We predicted that (1) individuals entering a population would aggregate with resident adults, (2) migrants would share sites with residents at a greater frequency than expected by chance, and (3) migrant home ranges would have shorter nearest-neighbor distances (NND) to residents than expected by chance. The results were consistent with these three predictions: Relative to random simulations, we observed significant aggregation, home-range overlap, and NND distribution functions in four, five, and six, respectively, of the six migrant-resident groups analyzed. Conspecific attraction may benefit migrant O.pumilio by providing cues to suitable home sites and/or increasing the potential for social interactions with conspecifics; if true, these benefits should outweigh the negative effects of other factors associated with aggregation. The observed aggregation between migrant and resident O.pumilio is consistent with conspecific attraction in dendrobatid frogs, and our study provides rare support from a field setting that conspecific attraction may be a relevant mechanism for models of anuran spatial ecology.","Folt, Brian

However, TSF carbon uptake is estimated using chronosequence studies that assume differently aged forests can be used to predict change in aboveground biomass density (AGBD) over time. We tested this assumption using two airborne lidar datasets separated by 11.5years over a Neotropical landscape. Using data from 1998, we predicted canopy height and AGBD within 1.1 and 10.3% of observations in 2009, with higher accuracy for forest height than AGBD and for older TSFs in comparison to younger ones. This result indicates that the space-for-time assumption is robust at the landscape-scale. However, since lidar measurements of secondary tropical forest are rare, we used the 1998 lidar dataset to test how well plot-based studies quantify the mean TSF height and biomass in a landscape. We found that the sample area required to produce estimates of height or AGBD close to the landscape mean is larger than the typical area sampled in secondary forest chronosequence studies. For example, estimating AGBD within 10% of the landscape mean requires more than thirty 0.1ha plots per age class, and more total area for larger plots. We conclude that under-sampling in ground-based studies may introduce error into estimations of the TSF carbon sink, and that this error can be reduced by more extensive use of lidar measurements.","Becknell, Justin M.

Here, I report on a wet-season study that examined whether seasonal changes in community composition affect these patterns. Males were captured, photographed, and marked, perch heights among individuals and species on natural and artificial perches (25, 50, and 100cm) were compared, and the frequencies of aggressive interactions between species were analyzed. I also examined the responses of Micrathyria atra and Micrathyria mengeri males to decoys of these species placed in their territory at different heights (50 or 100cm). Although the wet season community differed from the dry season community (Jaccard dissimilarity = 0.778), there was still a significant correlation between species perch height and body size, on both natural and artificial perches. Interspecific interactions supported the size-dependent competitive hierarchy hypothesis: smaller species that perched low avoided attacks by larger species. These patterns were confirmed in the decoy experiment. The larger M. atra, which perches at approximate to 100cm, attacked decoys at 100cm almost exclusively, and attacked decoys of the smaller M. mengeri more than conspecifics. In contrast, M. mengeri (which perches at 50cm) only attacked decoys placed at 50cm. Although community membership changed, the correlation between body size and perch height was maintained by a size-dependent competitive hierarchy in both dry and rainy seasons.","Worthen, Wade B.","Worthen, WB",NA,"229",NA,NA,NA,"10.1080/13887890.2018.1536894",NA,"239","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,"J",NA,"2018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1388-7890","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ODONATOLOGY",NA,"Confirming the relationship between body size and perch height in

The experimental site, La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, provided access for field validation and spectral data acquisition of individual tree canopies from established canopy towers. It is also a representative biome of diverse lowland Atlantic tropical forests in Central America. The process defined in this paper calibrated and corrected field-acquired ASD field spectra for ten tree species and corrected WorldView-3 image data for viewing and illumination geometry. In addition, assessments of three current atmospheric compensation methods for correcting recent WorldView-3 satellite imagery established the most accurate compensation process for a tropical forest setting. Corrected reflectance in the satellite data matched the spectrometer data to +/- 0.25% for visible bands and +/- 0.5% for near-infrared bands. This study shows that spectral data from the satellite and field spectrometer data are nearly equivalent when applying the appropriate atmospheric compensation, band response emulation, and viewing correction processes established in this study.","Cross, Matthew D.

In particular, canopy trees determine ecosystem nutrient conditions, but competitive success for nutrients and light during the sapling bottleneck determines canopy composition. We conducted an in situ multi-nutrient sapling fertilization experiment at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, to determine how functional group identity, species identity and light availability can impact nutrient limitation of stem growth in three functional groups and nine species. Despite high soil fertility, we found nutrient-light limitation in two functional groups and four species. Unexpectedly, the nitrogen-fixing (N-2 fixers) and shade-tolerant functional groups were significantly nutrient limited, while the light-demanding functional group was not. This was partially explained by species-level variation in nutrient limitation within these functional groups, with only some species conforming to the prediction of stronger nutrient limitation in light demanders compared to shade-tolerants. Most surprisingly, we found strong nutrient limitation at low-light levels in the N-2 fixers (which were shade-tolerant), but not in the shade-tolerant non-fixers. We hypothesize that the N-2 fixers were actually nitrogen limited at low-light levels because of their nitrogen-rich leaves and the high carbon cost of their symbionts. This finding suggests a highly shade-tolerant, N-2 fixation strategy, in addition to the perception that N-2 fixation is mostly advantageous in high-light environments during early and gap succession. The shade-tolerant, N-2 fixation strategy may be part of a sapling and canopy tree feedback, where the canopy N-2 fixers enrich the soil N, enhancing growth of their shade-tolerant saplings relative to non-fixing competitors, enabling further canopy domination by shade-tolerant N-2 fixers, as seen at La Selva.Synthesis. The pervasiveness of functional group- and species-specific nutrient and light co-limitation in our saplings indicates that these interactions likely play an important role in the dynamics of lowland tropical rainforest nutrient limitation, potentially via other such sapling and canopy tree feedbacks as the one hypothesized.","Chou, Cleo B.

Nonetheless, information on their propagation potential under nursery conditions to facilitate their use in forest restoration is scarce. This article studies the propagation potential of a tropical palm assemblage focusing on seed collection and germination patterns in the rainforest of Tirimbina, Costa Rica. From October 2013 to January 2016, we evaluated palm fruit availability and analyzed the germination potential of 5,172 seeds from 21 species monitored weekly for 57 weeks. Palm fruits were available all year; the percentage germination was 65.6%, and 90% of seeds germinated in 7 to 25 weeks. Contrary to the prevalent view that palms have low germination, germination was completed relatively fast. Palm propagation is limited by low species abundance rather than by fruit availability or germination potential. To propagate palms for restoration projects, we suggest to determine the species abundance and diversity at the study site, identify propagation priorities according to the species conservation status, and collect fruits throughout the year in a systematic way to include the greatest species and habitat diversity and infer the phenological patterns that will guide future seed collection. Our results are relevant to foster palm propagation with the purpose of including palms in forest restoration and increase our understanding of palm ecology, conservation, and regeneration strategies.","Manuel Ley-Lopez, Juan

"36","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Humid tropical forests are major players in the global carbon cycle, despite evidence that cations (rock-derived, positively charged ions) can limit or co-limit net primary productivity (NPP). In mature forests, tight cation cycling, i.e., without leaching losses, could maintain cation stocks on site. That mechanism does not explain how regenerating tropical secondary forest trees start from seeds and accrue large cation stocks in biomass, when growing on soils depleted in available cations. We propose a new mechanism that links tree species' traits to soil cation availability via impacts on soil pH, a master biogeochemical driver. We tested plot-level effects of tree species on soil pH, soil extractable cations, and cation accrual in biomass in a unique, 25-yr-old, randomized-complete-block experiment in which climate, soil, and previous land-use history were similar across four native tree species grown in mono-dominant plantations in Costa Rica. Surface-soil pH in this Oxisol, initially 4.52 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE (standard error)), declined to 4.14 +/- 0.02 under Pentaclethra macroloba, a nodulated legume, and increased to 4.71 +/- 0.08 under Vochysia guatemalensis, an aluminum (Al) accumulator. The range in pH corresponds to a five-fold difference in proton concentrations, which is sufficient to alter dispersion of organo-mineral colloids. Cation stocks in biomass differed across species by 1.7-, 1.9-, 2.8-, 2.9-, 3.1-, 3.5-, and 17.2-fold for iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), strontium (Sr), magnesium (Mg), and Al, respectively. Differential acquisition of available soil cations was an unlikely explanation for measured differences among species because changes in extractable soil cation stocks were unrelated to cation accrual in biomass. Soil pH and biomass cation stocks were highly correlated, however. By our proposed conceptual framework, species traits that strongly increase proton concentrations and decrease pH in soil, e.g., support of N fixation, increase colloid aggregation, reducing cation availability. Traits that reduce soil protons and increase pH, e.g., Al+3 accumulation, disperse colloids, thereby releasing cations occluded during pedogenesis. This highlights a novel biogeochemical role for the Al-accumulation trait, i.e., liberation of occluded soil cations. Further studies would clarify effects of soil pH on cation supply via colloid dispersion, and its importance for nutrient acquisition in cation-depleted soils.","Russell, Ann E.

Such specialization is postulated to increase insect fitness, but may simultaneously reduce insect ability to colonize novel hosts. During the Paleocene-Eocene, plants from the order Zingiberales became isolated either in the Paleotropics or in the Neotropics. During the Cretaceous, rolled-leaf beetles diversified in the Neotropics concurrently with Neotropical Zingiberales. Using a community of Costa Rican rolled-leaf beetles and their Zingiberales host plants as study system, we explored if previous geographic isolation precludes insects to expand their diets to exotic hosts. We recorded interactions between rolled-leaf beetles and native Zingiberales by combining DNA barcodes and field records for 7450 beetles feeding on 3202 host plants. To determine phylogenetic patterns of diet expansions, we established 20 experimental plots in the field, in which we planted plots five exotic Zingiberales, recording beetles feeding on these exotic hosts. In the laboratory, using both native and exotic host plants, we reared a subset of insect species that had expanded their diets to the exotic plants. The original plant-herbivore community comprised 24 beetle species feeding on 35 native hosts, representing 103 plant-herbivore interactions. After exotic host plant introduction, 20 percent of the beetle species expanded their diets to exotic Zingiberales. Insects only established on exotic hosts that belong to the same plant family as their native hosts. Laboratory experiments show that beetles are able to complete development on these novel hosts. In conclusion, rolled-leaf beetles are preadapted to expand their diets to novel host plants even after millions of years of geographic isolation.","Garcia-Robledo, Carlos

To answer this question requires tracking forest structure and dynamics through time and across within-forest environmental heterogeneity. While the impacts of major environmental gradients in soil nutrients, climate and topography on lowland tropical rain forest (TRF) structure and function have been extensively analyzed, the effects of the shorter environmental gradients typical of mesoscale TRF landscapes remain poorly understood. To evaluate multi-decadal performance of an old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we established 18 0.5-ha annually-censused forest inventory plots in a stratified-random design across major landscape edaphic gradients. Over the 17-year study period, there were moderate differences in stand dynamics and structure across these gradients but no detectable difference in woody productivity. We found large effects on forest structure and dynamics from the mega-Nino event at the outset of the study, with subdecadal recovery and subsequent stabilization. To extend the timeline to >40 years, we combined our findings with those from earlier studies at this site. While there were annual to multiannual variations in the structure and dynamics, particularly in relation to local disturbances and the mega-Nino event, at the longer temporal scale and broader spatial scale this landscape was remarkably stable. This stability contrasts notably with a current hypothesis of increasing biomass and dynamics of TRF, which we term the Bigger and Faster Hypothesis (B&FHo). We consider possible reasons for the contradiction and conclude that it is currently not possible to independently assess the vast majority of previously published B&FHo evidence due to restricted data access.","Clark, David B.

As trees increase in size they create microhabitats for late-colonizing species in both small and large branches while maintaining small tree microhabitats for early colonizing species in the small and young branches. Thus, epiphyte succession may follow different models depending on the scale: at the scale of the entire tree, epiphytes may follow a species accumulation model where species are continuously added to the tree as trees increase in size but at the scale of one zone on a branch (e.g., inner crown: 0-2 m from the trunk), they may follow the replacement model of succession seen in terrestrial ecosystems. Assuming tree size as an indicator of tree age, I surveyed 61 Virola koschnyi trees of varying size (2.5-103.3 cm diameter at breast height) in lowland wet tropical forest in Costa Rica to examine how epiphyte communities change through succession. Epiphyte communities in small trees were nested subsets of those in large trees and epiphyte communities became more similar to the largest trees as trees increased in size. Furthermore, epiphyte species in small trees were replaced by mid-and late-successional species in the oldest parts of the tree crown but dispersed toward the younger branches as trees increased in size. Thus, epiphyte succession followed a replacement model in particular zones within treecrowns but a species accumulation model at the scale of the entire tree crown.","Woods, Carrie L.","Woods, CL",NA,"452",NA,NA,NA,"10.1111/btp.12443",NA,"460","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"JUL",NA,"J",NA,"2017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"Primary ecological succession in vascular epiphytes: The species

Soil respiration was measured regularly over 2004 to 2010 in replicated plantations of 15-to 20-year-old evergreen tropical trees in lowland Costa Rica. Statistically significant but small differences in soil respiration were observed among hours of the day; daytime measurements were suitable for determining mean fluxes in this study. Fluxes varied more substantially among months, with the highest average emissions (5.9 mu mol.m(2).s(-1)) occurring in September and low emissions (3.7 mu mol.m(2).s(-1)) occurring in January. Three of the six tree species had significantly increasing rates of soil respiration across 2004-2010, with fluxes increasing at an average of 0.09 mu mol.m(2).s(-1) per year: the three other species had no long-term trends. It was hypothesized that there would be a tradeoff between carbon allocation aboveground, to produce new leaves, and belowground, to sustain roots and mycorrhizae, but the relationship between canopy leaf fall-a surrogate for canopy leaf flushing-and soil respiration was significantly positive. The similarities observed among temporal trends across plantation types, and significant relationships between soil respiration, soil water content and soil temperature, suggest that the physical environment largely controlled the temporal variability of soil respiration, but differences in flux magnitude among tree species were substantial and consistent across years.","Raich, James W.","Raich, JW",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/f8020040",NA,NA,"Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"FEB",NA,"J",NA,"2017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"FORESTS",NA,"Temporal Variability of Soil Respiration in Experimental Tree

Yet, factors affecting changes in species and functional trait composition of trees during forest succession remain poorly understood. The environmental filtering hypothesis of community assembly predicts gradual successional changes in functional trait composition. However, differences in landscape conditions and local site factors can lead to idiosyncratic or divergent changes in species and functional composition.
We examine community assembly patterns of canopy trees and palms during natural regeneration using functional trait measurements and 18 years of annual vegetation dynamics data from six second growth and two old-growth forest stands in northeast Costa Rica. We measured eight functional traits on 94 species, which cumulatively accounted for at least 80% of the abundance in each plot. Old-growth specialists had significantly lower leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content and significantly higher wood specific gravity than second-growth specialists. At the community level, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, leaf dry matter content, and leaf toughness showed directional trends from more acquisitive trait values towards more conservative trait values. The landscape context was also an important driver of the successional trends within and among plots, as most functional trait patterns were influenced by the location of the plots within the matrix. Furthermore, the differential abundance of palms among stands strongly influenced functional trait differences among plots. After accountibg for the effects of stand basal area and stand location, random plot effects explained an additional 45-90% of the variation in community-weighted mean functional traits. Local and landscape scale heterogeneity often influenced functional trait variation more strongly than stand basal area, suggesting that both stochasticity and environmental filtering influence species and functional turnover during succession.

To learn more about the factors involved in gap crossing behavior, we used predator-playback experiments on four species of understory-insectivore birds (Chestnut-backed Antbird Poliocrania exsul, Black-crowned Antshrike Thamnophilus atrinucha, White-breasted Wood-wren Henicorhina leucosticta, Stripe-breasted Wren Cantorchilus thoracicus) at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We sought to understand species-and family-level differences in gap crossing behavior, specifically: (1) the effect of forest-opening (gap) width, and (2) the effect of perceived risk of predation. A total of 39 treatment (predator playback) and 39 control (silent playback) trials were conducted at gap sites ranging in width from 2.8 to 12.6 m. Predator playback decreased the number of times that birds crossed study gaps, increased latency time in all but one species, and increased the closest distance that birds approached the playback speaker. Gap width affected only latency time: as gap width increased, latency time increased. We observed strong differences in behavioral response between families and species of different foraging heights. In the statistical models, family (Thamnophilidae and Troglodytidae), foraging height (low or mid-story), and trial type (silent control or predator treatment) consistently emerged as strongest predictors of bird behavior. Our results indicate that small linear gaps (< 12.6 m) do not impede movement for these four focal species, but that risk of predation may hinder bird movement even at small gaps.","Williamson, Jessie L.

I tested for this relationship in a guild of tropical dragonflies at a wetland at La Selva Biological Station, Heredia, Costa Rica. Males of 12 species were observed perching in January-February 2016. Mean male perch height was positively correlated with species body size. For six common species, I quantified differences in perch substrate selection, relationships between diurnal activity, temperature and radiation, and aggressive interactions. The largest species, Libellula herculea and Orthemis discolor, exhibited typical heliotherm behavior: they used sunny perches at mid-day, and activity correlated more with radiation than temperature. Orthemis cultriformis, a slightly smaller heliotherm, was active at mid-day but used shadier perches. Micrathyria atra - previously classified as a behavioral endotherm - behaved accordingly, avoiding over-heating by flying early and perching in moderate light. The smallest common species, Erythrodiplax fervida, departed from the expected thermoconformer behavior by showing no relationship between activity and temperature, perching throughout the day in shaded grasses. The medium-sized Cannaphila insularis was unusual, perching 1m higher than other species. Like larger heliotherms, activity occurred mid-day and correlated with solar radiation. Larger species exhibited greater degrees of interspecific aggression than smaller species. Cannaphila insularis is a docile species, but juveniles and females resemble the larger, more aggressive O. cultriformis.

To assess the strength of the new metric for LiDAR application, we use the full-waveform LVIS data acquired over La Selva, Costa Rica in 1998 and 2005. We illustrate how the Moment Distance Index (MDI) responds to waveform shape changes due to variations in signal noise levels. Our results show that the MDI is robust in the face of three different types of noise-additive, uniform additive, and impulse. In effect, the correspondence of the MDI with canopy quasi-height was maintained, as quantified by the coefficient of determination, when comparing original to noise-affected waveforms. We also compare MDIs from noise-affected waveforms to MDIs from smoothed waveforms and found that windows of 1% to 3% of the total wave counts can effectively smooth irregularities on the waveform without risking of the omission of small but important peaks, especially those located in the waveform extremities. Finally, we find a stronger positive relationship of MDI with canopy quasi-height than with the conventional area under curve (AUC) metric, e. g., r(2) = 0.62 vs. r(2) = 0.35 for the 1998 data and r(2) = 0.38 vs. r(2) = 0.002 for the 2005 data.","Salas, Eric Ariel L.

Eight-day ecotoxicological assays were conducted with red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) larvae to test for additive and interactive effects of exposure to the fungicide chlorothalonil, average temperature, and temperature variability on tadpole growth and survival. Egg masses were collected from seasonal ponds at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, and tadpoles were exposed to a series of chlorothalonil concentrations across a range of ecologically relevant mean temperatures (23.4-27.3 degrees C) and daily temperature fluctuations (1.1-9.9 degrees C). Survival was measured each day, and tadpole growth was measured at the end of each trial. Concentrations of chlorothalonil >= 60 mu g/L reduced survival, although survival was not affected by mean temperature or daily temperature range, and there were no synergistic interactions between chlorothalonil and temperature regime on survival. Chlorothalonil suppressed tadpole growth at relatively low concentrations (similar to 15 mu g/L). There were impacts of both average temperature and daily temperature range on tadpole growth, although there were no synergistic interactions between temperature regimes and chlorothalonil. The results should inform efforts to manage ecosystems impacted by multiple large-scale anthropogenic stressors as well as methods for the design of ecologically appropriate toxicology trials.

It is clear, however, that even in these comparatively well studied systems, a large proportion of symbiont biodiversity remains unknown. Even more striking is our lack of knowledge regarding the nature and specificity of these host-symbiont interactions. Here we surveyed the diversity and host specificity of rove beetles of the genus Tetradonia Wasmann, 1894 (Staphylinidae: Aleocharinae). Systematic community sampling of 58 colonies of the six local Eciton species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, combined with an integrative taxonomic approach, allowed us to uncover species diversity, host specificity, and co-occurrence patterns of symbionts in unprecedented detail. We used an integrative taxonomic approach combining morphological and genetic analyses, to delineate species boundaries. Mitochondrial DNA barcodes were analyzed for 362 Tetradonia specimens, and additional nuclear markers for a subset of 88 specimens. All analyses supported the presence of five Tetradonia species, including two species new to science. Host specificity is highly variable across species, ranging from generalists such as T. laticeps, which parasitizes all six local Eciton species, to specialists such as T. lizonae, which primarily parasitizes a single species, E. hamatum. Here we provide a dichotomous key along with diagnostic molecular characters for identification of Tetradonia species at La Selva Biological Station. By reliably assessing biodiversity and providing tools for species identification, we hope to set the baseline for future studies of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics in these species-rich host-symbiont networks.","von Beeren, Christoph

Recent evidence suggests that natural enemies could play an important role in the assembly of hyper-diverse tropical plant systems. Classic ecological theory predicts that in order for coexistence to occur, species differences must be maximized across biologically important niche dimensions. For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been recently suggested that, within a particular community, plant species that maximize the difference in chemical defense profiles compared to neighboring taxa will have a relative competitive advantage. Here we tested the hypothesis that plant chemical diversity can affect local community composition in the hyper-diverse genus Piper at a lowland wet forest location in Costa Rica. We first characterized the chemical composition of 27 of the most locally abundant species of Piper. We then tested whether species with different chemical compositions were more likely to coexist. Finally, we assessed the degree to which Piper phylogenetic relationships are related to differences in secondary chemical composition and community assembly. We found that, on average, co-occurring species were more likely to differ in chemical composition than expected by chance. Contrary to expectations, there was no phylogenetic signal for overall secondary chemical composition. In addition we found that species in local communities were, on average, more phylogenetically closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that functional traits other than those measured here also influence local assembly. We propose that selection by herbivores for divergent chemistries between closely related species facilitates the coexistence of a high diversity of congeneric taxa via apparent competition.","Salazar, Diego

For plant-herbivore interactions, it has been hypothesized that when plant species diversity is reduced, loss of plant biomass to herbivores increases. Although long-standing, this hypothesis has received mixed support. Increasing plant chemical diversity with increasing plant taxonomic diversity is likely to be important for plant-herbivore interactions at the community level, but the role of chemical diversity is unexplored. Here we assess the effect of volatile chemical diversity on patterns of herbivore damage in naturally occurring patches of Piper (Piperaceae) shrubs in a Costa Rican lowland wet forest. Volatile chemical diversity negatively affected total, specialist, and generalist herbivore damage. Furthermore, there were differences between the effects of high-volatility and low-volatility chemical diversity on herbivore damage. High-volatility diversity reduced specialist herbivory, while low-volatility diversity reduced generalist herbivory. Our data suggest that, although increased plant diversity is expected to reduce average herbivore damage, this pattern is likely mediated by the diversity of defensive compounds and general classes of anti-herbivore traits, as well as the degree of specialization of the herbivores attacking those plants.","Salazar, Diego

However, soil water availability and resources are also primary regulators of soil bacteria in many ecosystems. Separating the effects of these biotic and abiotic factors in the tropics is challenging because of their high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. To determine the drivers of tropical soil bacteria, we examined tree species effects using experimental tree monocultures and secondary forests at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. A randomized block design captured spatial variation and we sampled at four dates across two years to assess temporal variation. We measured bacteria richness, phylogenetic diversity, community composition, biomass, and functional potential. All bacteria parameters varied significantly across dates. In addition, bacteria richness and phylogenetic diversity were affected by the interaction of vegetation type and date, whereas bacteria community composition was affected by the interaction of vegetation type and block. Shifts in bacteria community richness and composition were unrelated to shifts in enzyme function, suggesting physiological overlap among taxa. Based on the observed temporal and spatial heterogeneity, our understanding of tropical soil bacteria will benefit from additional work to determine the optimal temporal and spatial scales for sampling. Understanding spatial and temporal variation will facilitate prediction of how tropical soil microbes will respond to future environmental change.","Kivlin, Stephanie N.

In northeastern Costa Rica, payments for environmental services (PES) and a government ban on deforestation have subsidized forest protection and reforestation in the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor (SJLSBC), resulting in a decline in mature forest loss and the expansion of tree plantations. We use field studies and graph models to assess how conservation efforts have altered functional connectivity over the last 25 years for four species of insectivorous understory birds. Field playback studies assessed how reforestation habitat quality affected the willingness of Myrmeciza exsul, Henicorhina leucosticta, Thamnophilus atrinucha, and Glyphorynchus spirurus to travel outside forest habitat for territorial defense. Observed travel distances were greatest in non-native and native tree plantations with high understory stem density, regardless of overstory composition. In contrast, tree plantations with low stem density had travel responses comparable to open pasture for three of the four bird species. We modeled landscape connectivity for each species using graph models based on varying possible travel distances in tree plantations, gallery forests, and pastures. From 1986 to 2011, connectivity for all species declined in the SJLSBC landscape (5825 km(2)) by 14% to 21% despite only a 4.9% net loss in forest area and the rapid expansion of tree plantations over 2% of the landscape. Plantation placement in the landscape limited their potential facilitation of connectivity because they were located either far from forest cover or within already contiguous forest areas. We mapped current connectivity bottlenecks and identified priority areas for future reforestation. We estimate that reforestation of priority areas could improve connectivity by 2% with only a 1% gain in forest cover, an impressive gain given the small area reforested. Results indicate key locations where spatial targeting of PES within the SJLSBC study region would protect existing forest connectivity and enhance the connectivity benefits of reforestation.","Fagan, Matthew E.

These structural components are important in the understanding of the past and future trajectories of these biomes. Tropical forests are often considered the most structurally complex and yet least understood of forested ecosystems. New technologies have provided novel avenues for quantifying biometric properties of forested ecosystems, one of which is LIght Detection And Ranging (lidar). This sensor can be deployed on satellite, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and terrestrial platforms. In this study we examined the efficacy of a terrestrial lidar scanner (TLS) system in a tropical forest to estimate forest structure. Our study was conducted in January 2012 at La Selva, Costa Rica at twenty locations in a predominantly undisturbed forest. At these locations we collected field measured biometric attributes using a variable plot design. We also collected TLS data from the center of each plot. Using this data we developed relative vegetation profiles (RVPs) and calculated a series of parameters including entropy, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), number of layers and plant area index to develop statistical relationships with field data. We developed statistical models using a series of multiple linear regressions, all of which converged on significant relationships with the strongest relationship being for mean crown depth (r(2) = 0.88, p < 0.001, RMSE = 1.04 m). Tree density was found to have the poorest significant relationship (r(2) = 0.50, p < 0.01, RMSE = 153.28 n ha(-1)). We found a significant relationship between basal area and lidar metrics (r(2) = 0.75, p < 0.001, RMSE = 3.76 number ha(-1)). Parameters selected in our models varied, thus indicating the potential relevance of multiple features in canopy profiles and geometry that are related to field-measured structure. Models for biomass estimation included structural canopy variables in addition to height metrics. Our work indicates that vegetation profiles from TLS data can provide useful information on forest structure.","Palace, Michael

While large extreme events such as tropical cyclones, fires, or pest outbreaks can produce dramatic consequences, small fine-scale disturbance events are typically much more common and may be as or even more important. This study focuses on the impacts of these smaller disturbance events on the predictability of vegetation dynamics and carbon flux. Using data on vegetation structure collected for the same domain at two different times, i.e. ""repeat lidar data"", we test high-resolution model predictions of vegetation dynamics and carbon flux across a range of spatial scales at an important tropical forest site at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We found that predicted height change from a height-structured ecosystem model compared well to lidar measured height change at the domain scale (similar to 150 ha), but that the model-data mismatch increased exponentially as the spatial scale of evaluation decreased below 20 ha. We demonstrate that such scale-dependent errors can be attributed to errors predicting the pattern of fine-scale forest disturbances. The results of this study illustrate the strong impact fine-scale forest disturbances have on forest dynamics, ultimately limiting the spatial resolution of accurate model predictions.","Hurtt, G. C.

While many carnivore populations are facing various threats such as habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and illegal trade, others have adapted to human-dominated landscapes. Information about Neotropical carnivore communities in particular is limited, especially in disturbed landscapes. We conducted a camera trap survey at 38 sites across the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor in Costa Rica to assess occupancy and detection probabilities of the carnivore community. We developed hypotheses within a likelihood-based framework in order to determine the landscape features and species traits (diet and size) that influenced their occupancy. We detected nine of the 13 native carnivores predicted to occur in the corridor. When modeled separately, each species responded to land cover changes differently, suggesting no strong community-wide predictors of occupancy. We then modeled three separate guilds within the carnivore community: omnivorous mesopredators, obligate carnivorous mesopredators, and apex predators. These community guild models revealed a negative relationship between omnivorous mesopredators and increasing forest and tree plantation cover, suggesting omnivores utilize forest fragments and edge habitats in agricultural landscapes. Obligate carnivorous mesopredator models did not reveal any strong habitat relationships, but landscape effects tended to contradict our a priori predictions. Apex predators were positively associated with increasing forest and tree plantation cover, protected areas, and increasing distances to villages. Alarmingly, apex predators and obligate carnivorous mesopredators were generally rare within the biological corridor. A lack of top-down control alone might result in heightened occupancy for all mesopredators, but because the community is dominated by omnivorous species, bottom-up release from human-induced land cover changes and resource provision may better explain their high occupancy.","Vargas, Lain E.

We performed a 20-month study using transect walks to survey the nonvolant mammal fauna in primary and secondary forests at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northeastern Costa Rica. We found that secondary forests can hold complex mammalian communities and no species exhibited habitat preferences between primary and secondary forests. With few exceptions, behavioral and group dynamic characteristics of mammal species were similar between forest types. Our research allows us to address methodological questions and assess the effectiveness of transect sampling. Monthly detection rates vary widely by species and likely reflect short-term changes in behavior rather than population fluctuations. Air temperature and rainfall are the factors most associated with monthly detection rates for various species. Small-scale areas of higher and lower use are evident for several species. Neither time of morning for surveys nor number of observers per trail affects detection rate. We report current abundances for the most commonly observed species and note generally lower densities in the Caribbean lowlands than elsewhere in the Neotropics. This research highlights that in less seasonal, evergreen forests climatic factors can still affect mammalian behavior. Overall, we find that secondary forests are of high conservation value and that transect walks are an effective methodology to sample many nonvolant mammal species, and we present recommendations on how to sample properly to conduct rigorous and long-term studies.","Romero, Andrea

We sampled 3 of the most common freshwater shrimp species, Macrobrachium olfersii, Macrobrachium carcinus, and Macrobrachium heterochirus, and used occupancy modeling and logistic regression models to improve our limited knowledge of distribution of these cryptic species by investigating both local- and landscape-scale effects at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Local-scale factors included substrate type and stream size, and landscape scale factors included presence or absence of regional groundwater inputs. Capture rates for 2 of the sampled species (M olfersii and M. carcinus) were sufficient to compare the fit of occupancy models. Occupancy models did not converge for M. heterochirus, but M. heterochirus had high enough occupancy rates that logistic regression could be used to model the relationship between occupancy rates and predictors. The best-supported models for M olfersii and M carcinus included conductivity, discharge, and substrate parameters. Stream size was positively correlated with occupancy rates of all 3 species. High stream conductivity, which reflects the quantity of regional groundwater input into the stream, was positively correlated with M olfersii occupancy rates. Boulder substrates increased occupancy rate of M carcinus and decreased the detection probability of M olfersii. Our models suggest that shrimp distribution is driven by factors that function at local (substrate and discharge) and landscape (conductivity) scales.","Snyder, Marcia N.

However, despite decades of research, our knowledge of army ant symbionts remains fragmentary due to taxonomic ambiguity and the inability to study army ants in the laboratory. Here, we present an integrative approach that allows us to reliably determine species boundaries, assess biodiversity, match different developmental stages and sexes, and to study the life cycles of army ant symbionts. This approach is based on a combination of community sampling, DNA barcoding, morphology and physiology. As a test case, we applied this approach to the staphylinid beetle genus Vatesus and its different Eciton army ant host species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. DNA barcoding led to the discovery of cryptic biodiversity and, in combination with extensive community sampling, revealed strict host partitioning with no overlap in host range. Using DNA barcoding, we were also able to match the larval stages of all focal Vatesus species. In combination with studies of female reproductive physiology, this allowed us to reconstruct almost the complete life cycles of the different beetle species. We show that Vatesus beetles are highly adapted to the symbiosis with army ants, in that their reproduction and larval development are synchronized with the stereotypical reproductive and behavioural cycles of their host colonies. Our approach can now be used to study army ant-symbiont communities more broadly, and to obtain novel insights into co-evolutionary and ecological dynamics in species-rich host-symbiont systems.","von Beeren, Christoph

Lizards adapted to living in lowland tropical areas are especially vulnerable because of their dependence on specific microhabitats, low vagility, and a reduced capacity to physiologically adjust to environmental change. To assess the potential effects of climate change on lizards in the lowland tropics, we measured the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of ten species from La Selva, Costa Rica. We also examined how well body size, microhabitat type, and species predicted the CTmax. We used current temperature data along with projected temperature increases for 2080 to predict which species may be at the greatest risk at La Selva. Of the ten species sampled, four are at serious risk of lowland extirpation and three others might also be at risk under the highest predicted temperature-increase models. Forest floor lizards at La Selva have already experienced significant population declines over the past 40 years, and we found that each of the forest floor species we studied is at serious risk of local extirpation. We also found that microhabitat type is the strongest predictor of CTmax, demonstrating the profound impact habitat specialization has on the thermal limits of tropical lizards.","Brusch, George A.

Microbial activity is a key regulator of available P through organic matter decomposition (supply) as well as microbial immobilization (depletion). Environmental conditions, such as soil moisture and temperature can fluctuate significantly on hourly to daily time-scales in tropical forested ecosystems. Given the ability of microbes to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions we would expect concomitant changes in the available soil P pool. Despite the potential for soil P availability to vary on short time-scales, research that investigates hourly to daily changes in the available soil P pool in tropical forests is extremely rare. We quantified diurnal fluctuations in labile soil P and the importance of biotic and abiotic factors in driving these patterns in a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Hourly measurements of Bray-extractable P were made from sunrise to sunset on five separate days along with measurements of soil temperature, moisture, pH, soil respiration, and solar radiation. While we found no significant diurnal variation in labile P, it did, however, vary significantly across the five sample days (2.8-3.8 A mu g/g). The day-to-day variation in labile P was positively related to soil moisture (R-2 = 0.42, p = 0.009). These findings illustrate the potential for rapid change in the available P pool in response to variable soil moisture status as well as the importance of considering soil moisture conditions when estimating P availability in the humid tropics.","Wood, Tana E.

We investigated carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) degassing from two streams at La Selva: the Arboleda, where approximately one third of the streamflow is from regional groundwater, and the Taconazo, fed exclusively by local groundwater recharged within the catchment. The regional groundwater inflow to the Arboleda had no measurable effect on stream gas exchange velocity, dissolved CH4 concentration, or CH4 emissions but significantly increased stream CO2 concentration and degassing. CO2 evasion from the reach of the Arboleda receiving regional groundwater (lower Arboleda) averaged 5.5molCm(-2)d(-1), similar to 7.5 times higher than the average (0.7molCm(-2)d(-1)) from the stream reaches with no regional groundwater inflow (the Taconazo and upper Arboleda). Carbon emissions from both streams were dominated by CO2; CH4 accounted for only 0.06-1.70% of the total (average of both streams: 5x10(-3)molCm(-2)d(-1)). Annual stream degassing fluxes normalized by watershed area were 48 and 299gCm(-2) for the Taconazo and Arboleda, respectively. CO2 degassing from the Arboleda is a significant carbon flux, similar in magnitude to the average net ecosystem exchange estimated by eddy covariance. Examining the effects of catchment connections to underlying hydrogeological systems can help avoid overestimation of ecosystem respiration and advance our understanding of carbon source/sink status and overall terrestrial ecosystem carbon budgets.","Oviedo-Vargas, Diana

Abundant large mammals can reshape forest structure, which degrades foraging microhabitat. We used six sites in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama with varying collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) density to test three linked hypotheses: (1) locally declining understory insectivores forage preferentially in liana tangles; (2) vine and liana density, cover, and frequency of dense tangles are lower in the presence of abundant collared peccaries; and consequently (3) abundant collared peccaries are associated with reduced understory insectivorous bird abundance. Three insectivores that declined at La Selva preferentially foraged in liana tangles: Checker-throated Antwren (Epinecrophylla fulviventris), Dot-winged Antwren (Microrhopias quixensis), and Ruddy-tailed Flycatcher (Terenotriccus erythrurus). Vine density, liana cover, liana tangle frequency, and forest cover were lower in the presence of collared peccaries relative to experimental mammal exclosures, with the greatest differences at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Across sites, five of seven vine and liana measures showed negative, curvilinear relationships with peccary densities. Vine and liana measures peaked at sites with intermediate peccary density, and were low at La Selva. Structural equation models suggest negative indirect effects of the collared peccaries on focal bird densities, mediated by vine and liana density, cover, or tangle frequency. Forest area and rainfall affected both lianas and birds, but collared peccaries also contributed to the reduced abundance of understory insectivores. Indirect effects such as that suggested here may occur even in large, protected forest reserves where large mammal communities are changing.","Michel, Nicole L.

Using 10 years of data from La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, we analyzed annual seedling survival and found that negative density-dependence (negative DD) was significantly stronger for rare species than for common species in 2 years and was significantly stronger for common species than for rare species in 4 years. This temporal variation in survival was correlated with climatic variables: in warmer and wetter years, common species had higher negative DD than rare species. The relationship between climate and variation in JC effects on seedling survival of common and rare species could have important consequences for the maintenance of tree species diversity in Central America, which is predicted to experience warmer and wetter years as global change proceeds.","Bachelot, Benedicte

Both understory and canopy species declined in abundance. Overall, insectivores showed the most pronounced declines but declines varied among trophic groups. The period from 2008 onward also was a period of stronger La Nina events which, at this study site, are associated with increased rainfall.

Avian responses to fragmentation at La Selva Biological Station are, in part, responsible for the particular concern over the fate of understory insectivorous species. However, since the 1990s, much previously deforested land within and surrounding La Selva has reverted to forest, providing an opportunity to test hypotheses explaining ongoing avifaunal change. Analyses of 23 years (1989-2011) of Christmas Bird Counts reveal that 63 of 202 species have increased whereas 44 are declining, with declines occurring more rapidly than increases. Habitat association was an important predictor of population trends, as understory birds continue to decline whereas forest generalists increased. Our results differ from previous work in the tropics by revealing that, at La Selva, insectivores are not currently suffering greater declines than birds of other dietary guilds. Instead, body size was more strongly associated with population change than was diet, with smaller birds having more negative population trends than larger birds. These results suggest that we must consider additional hypotheses that may explain ongoing population declines of tropical birds. In particular, the associations between population trends and body size implicate physiological mechanisms influencing population change, which may result from direct or indirect consequences of changing climates.

Here, we took advantage of chestnut-backed antbird (Myrmeciza exsul), a representative rainforest understory insectivore that persists in fragments (unlike many other understory species), to identify variables influencing nest predation rate and to test the hypothesis that nest predation underlies avian extirpation in tropical fragments. We compared nest predation rates, bird density, and predator identities in three habitats of lowland Caribbean Costa Rica: two fragments, a peninsular reserve (La Selva Biological Station), and unfragmented rainforest. Our results suggest an inversely density-dependent nest predation pattern: In fragments, chestnut-backed antbirds reached their highest density and contrary to predictions experienced their lowest nest predation rates; La Selva on the other hand experienced the lowest density and highest predation rate. Because nest predation decreased with fragmentation, it appears not to explain declines of understory insectivores from forest fragments generally. Nest survival models indicated that habitat best explained nest predation likelihood, whereas edge, annual, and nest age effects were unimportant. Video surveillance documented both bird-eating snake (Pseustes poecilonotus) causing 80% of nest loss overall (37 of 46 nests) and a larger variety of predators in fragments; thus, landscape factors influenced an understory bird's nest predation.

Most spiders were immature Araneidae, especially Eustala sp., but several other families of snare-building and wandering spiders were also among the prey. Male brood cells were more frequent in small diameter nests and at the inner end of nests. Female cells were more frequent in larger diameter nests and near the entrance. Mating almost always took place in the nest immediately before oviposition, but females were still able to determine the sex of the egg.

Soil microbial responses to altered rainfall are likely to be an important feedback on ecosystem carbon cycling, but the ecological mechanisms underpinning these responses are poorly understood. We examined how reduced rainfall affected soil microbial abundance, activity, and community composition using a 6-month precipitation exclusion experiment at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Thereafter, we addressed the persistent effects of field moisture treatments by exposing soils to a controlled soil moisture gradient in the lab for 4 weeks. In the field, compositional and functional responses to reduced rainfall were dependent on initial conditions, consistent with a large degree of spatial heterogeneity in tropical forests. However, the precipitation manipulation significantly altered microbial functional responses to soil moisture. Communities with prior drought exposure exhibited higher respiration rates per unit microbial biomass under all conditions and respired significantly more CO2 than control soils at low soil moisture. These functional patterns suggest that changes in microbial physiology may drive positive feedbacks to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations if wet tropical forests experience longer or more intense dry seasons in the future.","Waring, Bonnie G.

"76","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Tropical forests are huge reservoirs of terrestrial carbon and are experiencing rapid degradation and deforestation. Understanding forest structure proves vital in accurately estimating both forest biomass and also the natural disturbances and remote sensing is an essential method for quantification of forest properties and structure in the tropics. Our objective is to examine canopy vegetation profiles formulated from discrete return Light Detection And Ranging (lidar) data and examine their usefulness in estimating forest structural parameters measured during a field campaign. We developed a modeling procedure that utilized hypothetical stand characteristics to examine lidar profiles. In essence, this is a simple method to further enhance shape characteristics from the lidar profile. In this paper we report the results comparing field data collected at La Selva, Costa Rica (10 degrees 26' N, 83 degrees 59' W) and forest structure and parameters calculated from vegetation height profiles and forest structural modeling. We developed multiple regression models for each measured forest biometric property using forward stepwise variable selection that used Bayesian information criteria (BIC) as selection criteria. Among measures of forest structure, ranging from tree lateral density, diameter at breast height, and crown geometry, we found strong relationships with lidar canopy vegetation profile parameters. Metrics developed from lidar that were indicators of height of canopy were not significant in estimating plot biomass (p-value = 0.31, r(2) = 0.17), but parameters from our synthetic forest model were found to be significant for estimating many of the forest structural properties, such as mean trunk diameter (p-value = 0.004, r(2) = 0.51) and tree density (p-value = 0.002, r(2) = 0.43). We were also able to develop a significant model relating lidar profiles to basal area (p-value = 0.003, r(2) = 0.43). Use of the full lidar profile provided additional avenues for the prediction of field based forest measure parameters. Our synthetic canopy model provides a novel method for examining lidar metrics by developing a look-up table of profiles that determine profile shape, depth, and height. We suggest that the use of metrics indicating canopy height derived from lidar are limited in understanding biomass in a forest with little variation across the landscape and that there are many parameters that may be gleaned by lidar data that inform on forest biometric properties.

"78","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In this paper, we report on the performance of a semiempirical algorithm for the retrieval of soil moisture (SM) under dense tropical forests using ultrahigh frequency (UHF) polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The algorithm is a simplification of a 3-D coherent model of forest canopy based on the distorted Born approximation (DBA). The simplified model reduces the number of parameters and preserves the three dominant scattering mechanisms of volume, volume-surface, and surface for three polarized backscattering coefficients, i.e., sigma(HH), sigma(HV), and sigma(VV), at UHF frequencies. The inversion process uses the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least squaresmethod to estimate the three model parameters: vegetation aboveground biomass, integrated SM up to a certain depth, and surface roughness. The performance of the inversion process is examined by first using simulation data where the initial values of the inversion process vary randomly and then using airborne UHF SAR data acquired in Costa Rica over La Selva Biological Station. The results with simulated data show that the inversion process is not significantly sensitive to initial values considering they are in the range of +/- 50% of the true value. A root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 4% can be achieved in retrieving the SM. The use of an alternate inversion approach without initial conditions using a genetic algorithm is less efficient (> 120 times longer time) and produces larger error with simulated data (RMSE = 11%) than the Levenberg-Marquardt estimation method. The inversion model simultaneously produces a biomass and SM distribution at 100-m spatial resolution. The RMSE of biomass estimation is 38 Mg/ha (15% relative error) when compared with 28 field plots. Over the plots where SMground measurements are available, but not at the exact same day as the radar flight occurred, the total volumetric RMSE is 13.6%. However, only two ground measurements were very close to the flight day (three days apart), and for those, the SM estimate has about 3% absolute volumetric error. At the P-band, the SM sensing depth is inversely correlated with the SM allowing to map the spatial variations of SM close to the average root zone or hydrological active horizon of soils in tropical ecosystems.","Truong-Loi, My-Linh

As current knowledge on biomass accumulation during secondary succession is heavily based on chronosequence studies, direct estimates of annual rates of biomass accumulation in monitored stands are largely unavailable. We evaluated the contributions of tree diameter increment, recruitment, and mortality to annual tree biomass change during succession for three groups of tree species: second-growth (SG) specialists, generalists, and old-growth (OG) specialists. We monitored six second-growth tropical forests that varied in stand age and two old-growth forests in northeastern Costa Rica. We monitored these over a period of 8 to 16 years. To assess rates of biomass change during secondary succession, we compared standing biomass and biomass dynamics between second-growth forest stages and old-growth forest, and evaluated the effect of stand age on standing biomass and biomass dynamics in second-growth forests. Standing tree biomass increased with stand age during succession, whereas the rate of biomass change decreased. Biomass change was largely driven by tree diameter increment and mortality, with a minor contribution from recruitment. The relative importance of these demographic drivers shifted over succession. Biomass gain due to tree diameter increment decreased with stand age, whereas biomass loss due to mortality increased. In the age range of our second-growth forests, 10-41 years, SG specialists dominated tree biomass in second-growth forests. SG specialists, and to a lesser extent generalists, also dominated stand-level biomass increase due to tree diameter increment, whereas SG specialists largely accounted for decreases in biomass due to mortality. Our results indicate that tree growth is largely driving biomass dynamics early in succession, whereas both growth and mortality are important later in succession. Biomass dynamics are largely accounted for by a few SG specialists and one generalist species, Pentaclethra macroloba. To assess the generality of our results, similar long-term studies should be compared across tropical forest landscapes.","Rozendaal, Danae M. A.

The importance of microhabitats in structuring epiphyte communities has been hypothesized for more than 120years but not yet confirmed. We tested the importance of microhabitats in structuring epiphyte communities by examining microhabitat heterogeneity and epiphyte communities within the crowns of different-sized Virola koschnyi (Myristicaceae) emergent trees in a Costa Rican tropical wet forest. We tested the degree to which epiphyte species composition was associated with environmental conditions and resources (i.e. microhabitats) using multivariate analyses and a null model that compared the observed epiphyte assemblages amongst different-sized trees and crown zones with assemblages generated randomly. This study is the first to rigorously examine the degree of microhabitat specialization in epiphyte communities. Microhabitat heterogeneity, epiphyte species richness and abundance increased with tree size. The largest trees had the highest microhabitat and epiphyte diversity and a unique inner crown microhabitat with canopy humus. The few epiphytes found on small trees were mostly bark ferns. Large trees had different epiphyte communities in different parts of the crown; the inner crown contained species not abundant in any other microhabitat (i.e. aroids, cyclanths and humus ferns), and the outer crown contained bark ferns and atmospheric bromeliads. Variation in species composition amongst tree size classes was significantly related to the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and tree diameter, while variation within large tree crowns was significantly related to canopy humus cover. Microhabitat specialization of epiphyte species increased with tree size with 6% of species significantly associated with small trees and 57% significantly associated with large trees. Of the species present in large tree crowns, 23% were specialized to the unique inner crown microhabitat.Synthesis. The increase in microhabitat heterogeneity within tree crowns as trees grow contributes to changes in epiphyte community structure, which supports decades-old hypotheses of the importance of microhabitat diversity and specialization in structuring tropical epiphyte communities.","Woods, Carrie L.

However, few studies have quantified the influence of GMG inflows on export of biologically important solutes from watersheds across years differing in precipitation. We quantified N, soluble reactive P (SRP), and dissolved organic C (DOC) export during a year with high precipitation (6550 mm rain) and a year with average precipitation (4033 mm rain) in 2 gauged tropical streams at La Selva Biological Station in lowland Costa Rica. One stream receives extensive inputs of regional GMG, whereas the other is fed entirely by local runoff. In the stream fed only by local runoff, a 62% increase in precipitation from the dry year to the wet year led to a 68% increase in stream discharge, a 67% increase in export of SRP, DOC, dissolved organic N (DON), and NH4+, and a 91% increase in NO3- export. In contrast, in an adjacent stream where >1/3 of discharge consists of GMG, the same increase in precipitation from dry year to wet year led to a 14% increase in discharge, a 14 to 31% increase in export of NO3-, NH4+, DON, and DOC, and only a 2% increase in SRP export. We are unaware of an SRP export rate from a natural system that is higher than the export from the stream receiving interbasin flow of GMG (19 kg ha(-1) y(-1)). Our results illustrate that regional ground water, geothermally modified or not, can stabilize stream export of biologically relevant solutes and water across a varying precipitation regime.","Ganong, Carissa N.

Myxomycete assemblages associated with bark and wood from two different tropical life zones and two different forest stages were studied using a combination of basic ecological assessment methods and functional ecological approaches. Results showed that diversity, richness and evenness are all higher in dry forests than in wet ones, but almost no differences in the general structure of assemblages were found between old growth and successional forest patches. Abundance models for the assemblages studied seem to show, at least based on fruiting body information, narrower niche breadth values and a higher level of coexistence in dry areas. Differences were found across the two areas in the average number of fruiting bodies per fructification as well as on the characteristics of the spores and lignicolous substrates were myxomycetes were recorded.

Starting with the seminal paper of A.F.W. Schimper on epiphyte ecology in the late 19th century over 200 publications have dealt with the issue of host specificity in vascular epiphytes. We review and critically discuss this extensive literature. The available evidence indicates that host ranges of vascular epiphytes are largely unrestricted while a certain host bias is ubiquitous. However, tree size and age and spatial auto-correlation of tree and epiphyte species have not been adequately considered in most statistical analyses. More refined null expectations and adequate replication are needed to allow more rigorous conclusions. Host specificity could be caused by a large number of tree traits (e.g. bark characteristics and architectural traits), which influence epiphyte performance. After reviewing the empirical evidence for their relevance, we conclude that future research should use a more comprehensive approach by determining the relative importance of various potential mechanisms acting locally and by testing several proposed hypotheses regarding the relative strength of host specificity in different habitats and among different groups of structurally dependent flora.","Wagner, Katrin

At La Selva Biological Station in the lowlands of Costa Rica, amphibians, reptiles, and understory birds have all declined over the past four decades, yet the factors contributing to these declines remain unclear. Here, we conduct two tests of the hypothesis that faunal declines are linked to shifting dynamics of leaf litter, a critical microhabitat for amphibians and reptiles and a major component of forest carbon cycles. First, we conduct a 16-month manipulation of leaf litter and measure response by terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. Second, we synthesize three year-long datasets collected over four decades to evaluate potential multi-decade change in standing litter depth. We show that litter depth regulates density of amphibians and reptiles, and that the strongest response to manipulations is in species that decline most rapidly based on long-term data. Our synthesis of litter depth data suggests considerable interannual variability in standing stocks of leaf litter with lowest quantity of leaf litter in the most recent sampling period. These tests are consistent with the hypothesis that these faunal declines may be in part driven by changes in forest litter dynamics, and ultimately to climate-sensitive carbon cycles.","Whitfield, Steven M.

"85","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Due to the mixing of groundwaters with different ages in aquifers, groundwater age is more appropriately represented by a distribution rather than a scalar number. To infer a groundwater age distribution from environmental tracers, a mathematical form is often assumed for the shape of the distribution and the parameters of the mathematical distribution are estimated using deterministic or stochastic inverse methods. The prescription of the mathematical form limits the exploration of the age distribution to the shapes that can be described by the selected distribution. In this paper, the use of freeform histograms as groundwater age distributions is evaluated. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach is used to estimate the fraction of groundwater in each histogram bin. The method was able to capture the shape of a hypothetical gamma distribution from the concentrations of four age tracers. The number of bins that can be considered in this approach is limited based on the number of tracers available. The histogram method was also tested on tracer data sets from Holten (The Netherlands; H-3, He-3, Kr-85, Ar-39) and the La Selva Biological Station (Costa-Rica; SF6, CFCs, H-3, He-4 and C-14), and compared to a number of mathematical forms. According to standard Bayesian measures of model goodness, the best mathematical distribution performs better than the histogram distributions in terms of the ability to capture the observed tracer data relative to their complexity. Among the histogram distributions, the four bin histogram performs better in most of the cases. The Monte Carlo simulations showed strong correlations in the posterior estimates of bin contributions, indicating that these bins cannot be well constrained using the available age tracers. The fact that mathematical forms overall perform better than the freeform histogram does not undermine the benefit of the freeform approach, especially for the cases where a larger amount of observed data is available and when the real groundwater distribution is more complex than can be represented by simple mathematical forms.

Canopy profiles were derived from lidar data using the MacArthur-Horn transformation and from field data using a model we developed that uses two sets of allometric equations describing crown shape and tree height and a third from raw field data. We conducted a statistical comparison of seven asynchronous relative vegetation profiles (RVP) derived from different methodologies between the years of 2005 and 2012. We compared three airborne lidar datasets, three modeled profiles from field data, and one terrestrial lidar dataset using pairwise Mantel tests, multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) and a permutation-based comparison using a similarity index for within plot comparisons. We used the results of MRPP to determine possible drivers of poor agreement between instruments and models and found a moderate relationship between within-plot variability (observed delta) and estimated above ground biomass (r(2) = 0.273, p < 0.05), which we attribute to poor model performance on low density/low biomass plots. In addition, correlation analysis of height metrics derived from RVPs resulted in weak correlations at low height percentiles and strong correlations at higher percentiles. Overall, we identified general similarity between lidar profiles using MRPP (lidar only A = 0.202, p < 0.001), but poorer agreement between lidar and modeled profiles (all profiles A = 0.076, p < 0.001). We attribute some of these differences to selection of canopy profile models and to approaches used for accounting for canopy occlusion in lidar transformations. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using Mantel tests to estimate temporal scales of vertical structure change in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Starting in 1998, we investigated one of the most common frog species at La Selva, the poison-dart frog Oophaga pumilio (= Dendrobates pumilio). In a survey of 50 plots of 100 m(2) in 1998, adult frogs were 4.6 times more abundant in secondary forest than in primary forest. Tadpoles were found only in secondary-forest plots. Almost all (89%) of the tadpoles were found in leaf axils of Dieffenbachia spp., which were much more abundant in secondary-forest than in primary-forest plots. The greater abundance of Dieffenbachia spp. in secondary forest was confirmed in a broad survey of similar to 11 km of trails within La Selva in 2002. When the same trails were resampled in 2012, Dieffenbachia spp. had been extirpated from 72% of the 50-m segments where plants were present in 2002; abundance was greatly reduced in the few trail segments where any Dieffenbachia spp. remained in 2012. The loss of Dieffenbachia spp., especially in secondary forest, removed the species most often used by O. pumilio for tadpole rearing. Based on counts of calling frogs in 2010, there was no difference in O. pumilio abundance in primary versus secondary forest, in striking contrast to multiple earlier surveys that found much greater frog abundance in secondary forest. We propose that the reason for the rapid decline in Dieffenbachia spp. is herbivory by the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), which has increased in abundance at La Selva in recent years. A likely consequence is continued reduction in O. pumilio populations.","McKone, Mark J.

One approach to reducing these impacts is the establishment of biological corridors. Studies on corridor efficacy have been limited to a small subset of taxa; while important, these data can rarely be extrapolated to other systems. I tested whether Megaloprepus caerulatus, a giant tree-hole breeding damselfly adapted to mature Neotropical forests, can and does disperse from mature forest to fragments that are components of an established corridor. I monitored presence of M. caerulatus in four secondary forest fragments of the San Juan-La Selva biological corridor network and in the contiguous La Selva forest. I compared densities of adult M. caerulatus and larval presence in artificial and natural breeding sites over the course of one year. None of the artificial holes in fragments were colonized by M. caerulatus whereas at La Selva 25% of artificial holes and 63% of natural tree holes were colonized. I tested M. caerulatus's ability to fly over pasture between fragments with a dispersal challenge experiment. Although the damselfly successfully crossed gaps of 25 m, it had difficulty traversing gaps as narrow as 50-100 m. Based on analysis of 360 degrees photos taken from each release distance, the forest edge was less distinguishable from distances >= 50 m. These results suggest limited conservation utility of existing biological corridor networks for M caerulatus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"89","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Decades of studies on the role of decomposition in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling have focused on organic matter (OM) of plant origin. Despite potentially large inputs of belowground OM from fungal cell walls and invertebrate exoskeletons, studies of the decomposability of their major constituent, chitin, are scarce. To explore effects on soil C dynamics of chitin, in comparison with two plant-derived chemicals, cellulose and lignin, I conducted a field-based chemical-addition experiment. The design contained three chemical treatments plus a control, with four replicates in each of two species of tropical trees grown in plantations. The chemicals were added in reagent-grade form at a rate that doubled the natural detrital C inputs of 1000 g C m(-2) y(-1). Despite its purported recalcitrance, chitin was metabolized quickly, with soil respiration (R (soil)) increasing by 64% above the control within days, coupled with a 32% increase in soil extractable ammonium. Cellulose, which was expected to be labile, was not readily decomposed, whereas lignin was rapidly metabolized at least partially in one of the forest types. I examined effects of stoichiometry by adding to all treatments ammonium nitrate in a quantity that adjusted the C:N of cellulose (166) to that of chitin (10), using both field and in vitro experiments. For cellulose, CO2 release increased more than five- to eightfold after N addition in root-free soil incubated in vitro, but only 0-20% in situ where roots were intact. By the end of the 2-year-long field experiment, fine-root biomass tended to be higher in the chitin treatment, where R (soil) was significantly higher. Together these findings suggest that soil N availability limited cellulose decomposition, even in this Neotropical forest with high soil N stocks, and also that trees successfully competed for N that became available as chitin decomposed. These results indicate that the major constituent of cell walls of soil fungi, chitin, can decompose rapidly and release substantial N that is available for plant and microbial growth. As a consequence, soil fungi can stimulate soil OM decomposition and N cycling, and thereby play a disproportionate role in ecosystem C and N dynamics.","Russell, Ann E.","Russell, AE",NA,"918",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s10021-014-9769-1",NA,"930","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"AUG",NA,"J",NA,"2014","Russell, Ann/F-3153-2017","Russell, Ann/0000-0001-5410-3361",NA,NA,NA,"1432-9840","ECOSYSTEMS",NA,"Unexpected Effects of Chitin, Cellulose, and Lignin Addition on Soil

Ocotea seedlings produce specialized nodules on the main stem that are used as domatia by founding queens. In this study, Ocotea seedlings were colonized by multiple haplometrotically founding M. flavocotea queens.

The number of foundress queens per tree was positively correlated with seedling height and stem diameter (nesting space) at time of colony founding. The extent to which foundress queens cooperate in colony founding is not known. Nonetheless, colony establishment by multiple foundress queens may be critical in ensuring the successful founding by at least one queen, thus allowing the perpetuation of the Myrmelachista-Ocotea interaction.","Kuhn, K.

We conducted camera-trap and track surveys at 38 forested sites in and around the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica. Cameras were set along established game trails and natural funnels and operated for 14-38 days per site. Additionally, we documented tapir tracks at many sites. We used survey photographs and track presence to create detection histories to estimate the habitat and survey-specific variables that influence the probability of detection and the probability of occurrence of Baird's tapir. The two major protected areas within and adjacent to the corridor were most positively associated with tapir occurrence, and forest cover and native and exotic tree plantations were also positively associated with tapirs' use of sites. Although the Baird's tapir is rare, our findings suggest that it is more resilient and better able to use available habitat in the fragmented corridor than previously thought. This is most likely a consequence of increased forest cover from reforestation and tree plantations and limited hunting pressure. Given its charismatic nature we recommend that Baird's tapir could be used as a flagship species for the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor, to raise local awareness about conservation and increase economic growth from ecotourism.","Cove, Michael V.

"93","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Young secondary forests and plantations in the moist tropics often have rapid rates of biomass accumulation and thus sequester large amounts of carbon. Here, we compare results from mature forest and nearby 15-20 year old tree plantations in lowland Costa Rica to evaluate differences in allocation of carbon to aboveground production and root systems. We found that the tree plantations, which had fully developed, closed canopies, allocated more carbon belowground - to their root systems - than did mature forest. This increase in belowground carbon allocation correlated significantly with aboveground tree growth but not with canopy production (i.e., leaf fall or fine litter production). In contrast, there were no correlations between canopy production and either tree growth or belowground carbon allocation. Enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can enhance plant nutrient uptake, providing nutrients beyond those required for the production of short-lived tissues such as leaves and fine roots, and thus enabling biomass accumulation. Our analyses support this deduction at our site, showing that enhanced allocation of carbon to root systems can be an important mechanism promoting biomass accumulation during forest growth in the moist tropics. Identifying factors that control when, where and for how long this occurs would help us to improve models of forest growth and nutrient cycling, and to ascertain the role that young forests play in mitigating increased atmospheric carbon dioxide.","Raich, James W.

Natural and anthropogenic gradients influence the variation of environmental and biotic factors, which determine population demography and dynamics. Successional gradients are expected to influence demographic parameters, but the relationship between these gradients and the species life history, habitat requirements, and degree of variation in demographic traits remains elusive.
Methods: We used the palm Euterpe precatoria to test the effect of successional stage on plant demography within a continuous population. We calculated demographic parameters for size stages and performed matrix analyses to investigate the demographic variation within primary and secondary forests of La Selva, Costa Rica.
Key results: We observed differences in mortality and recruitment of small juveniles between primary and secondary forests. Matrix models described satisfactorily the chronosequence of population changes, which were characterized by high population growth rate in disturbed areas, and decreased growth rate in old successional forests until reaching stability.
Conclusions: Different demographic parameters can be expressed in contiguous subpopulations along a gradient of successional stages with important consequences for population dynamics. Demographic variation superimposed on these gradients contributes to generate subpopulations with different demographic composition, density, and ecological properties. Therefore, the effects of spatial variation must be reconsidered in the design of demographic analyses of tropical palms, which are prime examples of subtle local adaptation. These considerations are crucial in the implementation of management plans for palm species within spatially complex and heterogeneous tropical landscapes.","Fernandez Otarola, Mauricio

"95","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","The existence of monodominant forests on well-drained soils in tropical regions has been widely reported. Such forests most likely result from a combination of both ecological and evolutionary factors. Under conditions of high seed and seedling mortality, vegetative reproduction could create a reproductive advantage leading to forest dominance, and profoundly affect the distribution of genetic variation in a clonal species. We investigated these effects in a low diversity forest site in Northeastern Costa Rica dominated by the species Pentaclethra macroloba, which sprouts from the root mass of fallen trees and from snapped trunks. We examined the population structure of juvenile R macroloba growing in different soil types and across an elevational gradient. Using seven molecular markers, we genotyped 173 juvenile P. macroloba from 18 plots (six plots in seasonally inundated swamps, and 12 plots in upland non-swamp) spanning 50-300m in elevation at La Selva Biological Station and the adjacent Reserva Ecologica Bijagual in Northeastern Costa Rica. We answered two specific questions: (1) How extensive is clonal reproduction? and (2) what is the distribution of genetic diversity and structure?. We found that clonal reproduction occurred exclusively within inundated swamp areas. However, there was no significant difference between genetic diversity measures in swamp and non-swamp plots, which were both generally low when compared with other tropical forest species. Genetic structure was significant across all plots (F-ST=0.109). However, genetic structure among swamp plots (F-ST=0.128) was higher than among non-swamp upland plots (F-ST=0.093). Additionally, spatial autocorrelation among individuals within non-swamp upland plots was significant from the 25 to 100m spatial scale, but not within swamp plots. The degree of overall genetic structure we found in R macroloba is high for a tropical forest tree. The incidence of clonal reproduction is a contributing factor in genetic differentiation, but the high structure among plots without clonal reproduction indicates that other factors contribute as well.","Gaddis, Keith D.

The conspicuous coloration of these frogs is generally considered to be an aposematic signal to color-visioned predators. A previous field-based experiment tested this hypothesis in the dendrobatid frog Oophaga pumilio (Strawberry Poison Frog) from the La Selva Biological Station using a stationary clay model experiment to assess natural predation. Avian predation rates on brown frog models were almost twice that of red frog models, supporting the hypothesis that coloration in O. pumilio is aposematic. A criticism of clay model experiments has been that they do not accurately represent natural organisms, especially with regard to movement. Many predators utilize movement in prey selection and, therefore, may not perceive motionless clay models as prey. In an attempt to understand the importance of movement better in assessing natural predation rates using clay model experiments, we conducted a similar field-based clay model experiment but instead used moving models of O. pumilio and of brown control frogs. Moving brown models were attacked more than nine times the rate of moving red models, supporting the finding of the previous study and providing further evidence that color is aposematic in O. pumilio. When compared directly to the previous study using stationary clay models, birds attacked moving brown models significantly more whereas red moving models were attacked significantly less. Our findings suggest that moving models may provide a better estimate of natural predator responses to an aposematic frog.","Paluh, Daniel J.

Defining hemiepiphytism in ferns is complicated by the presence of separate, free-living gametophyte and sporophyte stages. Currently, we lack detailed field observations into fern species that have historically been referred to as hemiepiphytes, especially as to whether the gametophytes establish themselves on mineral soil, rotting logs, or the bases of tree trunks. In addition, nothing is known of the physiological shifts that can occur as an individual fern moves from a terrestrial habit to a climbing habit. The goal of this work is to describe the developmental ecology of species that have been termed hemiepiphytes in Polybotrya and examine the ecophysiological changes between terrestrial and climbing individuals.Methodology.The research was carried out at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, where the developmental ecology was studied in plots across the forest. We surveyed for presence/absence of gametophytes and sporophytes on different substrates. We then selected sporophytes in both terrestrial and climbing conditions and made several ecophysiological measurements in the field and lab.Pivotal results.In one of the few studies of its kind, we describe the gametophyte morphology, what substrates the gametophytes grow on (mineral soil, rotting logs, or bases of trunks), and sporophyte development and ecology of Polybotrya caudata Kunze and Polybotrya osmundacea Willd. Contrary to modern reports, neither species conformed to the classic definition of a hemiepiphyte. We propose the new term root-climber to refer to a species that begins as a terrestrial individual and then shifts to a climbing habit but still maintains its connection to the ground, using adhesive roots on the stems as the main mechanism of attachment. We also find that climbing can elicit distinctive physiological responses, and these responses can be species specific. In P. osmundacea Willd., changes associated with climbing concerned water relations, not light. There were no discernible physiological changes in P. caudata as a function of climbing.Conclusions.The ecology of ferns is complex given the reliance on independent gametophytes and sporophytes with unique habitat requirements. Studies that attempt to examine fern ecology must carefully consider both stages of the life cycle. This is especially true in cases where taxa have been referred to as hemiepiphytes.","Canestraro, Bianca K.

Because birds are major seed dispersers in rainforests, fragmentation-induced changes to frugivorous bird assemblages are also likely to alter the ecological processes of seed dispersal and forest regeneration, but the specific nature of these changes is poorly understood. We assessed the influence of fragment size and landscape forest cover on the abundance, species composition, and functional properties of the avian seed disperser community in an extensively cleared, former rainforest landscape of subtropical Australia. Bird surveys of fixed time and area in 25 rainforest fragments (1-139 ha in size across a 1800 km(2) region) provided bird assemblage data which were coupled with prior knowledge of bird species' particular roles in seed dispersal to give measurements of seven different attributes of the seed disperser assemblage. We used multimodel regression to assess how patch size and surrounding forest cover (within 200 m, 1000 m, and 5000 m radii) influenced variation in the abundance of individual bird species and of functional groups based on bird species' responses to fragmentation and their roles in seed dispersal. Surrounding forest cover, specifically rainforest cover, generally had a greater effect on frugivorous bird assemblages than fragment size. Amount of rainforest cover within 200 m of fragments was the main factor positively associated with abundances of frugivorous birds that are both fragmentation sensitive and important seed dispersers. Our results suggest a high proportion of local rainforest cover is required for the persistence of seed-dispersing birds and the maintenance of seed dispersal processes. Thus, even small rainforest fragments can function as important parts of habitat networks for seed-dispersing birds, whether or not they are physically connected by vegetation. Respuestas de Aves Dispersoras de Semillas al Incremento de Selvas en el Paisaje Alrededor de Fragmentos
Resumen La perdida de habitat y la fragmentacion alteran la composicion del ensamblaje de aves en la selva. Ya que las aves son el principal dispersor de semillas en las selvas, los cambios inducidos por la fragmentacion al ensamblaje de aves frugivoras probablemente tambien alteren los procesos ecologicos de la dispersion de semillas y la regeneracion de bosques, pero la naturaleza especifica de estos cambios es entendida pobremente. Estudiamos la influencia del tamano de fragmento y la cobertura de bosque en el paisaje sobre la abundancia, la composicion de especies y las propiedades funcionales de la comunidad de especies de aves dispersoras de semillas en un paisaje despejado extensivamente y previamente de selva en Australia subtropical. Los censos de aves en un tiempo y area fijos en 25 fragmentos de selva (1 - 139 ha de tamano a lo largo de una region de 1 800 Km(2)) proporcionaron datos de ensamblaje de aves que se parearon con el conocimiento previo de los papeles particulares de las especies de aves en la dispersion de semillas para dar medidas de siete atributos diferentes del ensamblaje del dispersor de semillas. Usamos una regresion multi-modelo para estudiar como el tamano de fragmento y la cobertura de bosque proxima (dentro de 200 m, 1000 m y 5000 m de radio) influyeron en la variacion de la abundancia de especies individuales de aves y de los grupos funcionales basados en las respuestas de las especies de aves a la fragmentacion y su papel en la dispersion de semillas. La cobertura forestal proxima, especificamente la cobertura de selva, en general tuvo un mayor efecto sobre el ensamblaje de aves frugivoras que el tamano del fragmento. El incremento de la cobertura de selva dentro de los 200 m de fragmentos fue el factor principal asociado positivamente con las abundancias de aves frugivoras que son sensibles a la fragmentacion y dispersores importantes de semillas. Nuestros resultados sugieren que se requiere una alta proporcion de cobertura local de selva para la persistencia de aves dispersoras y el mantenimiento del proceso de dispersion de semillas. Asi, hasta el mas minimo fragmento de selva puede funcionar como parte importante de una red de habitats para aves dispersoras, esten o no conectadas fisicamente por la vegetacion.","Moran, Cath

In captivity, bats can rapidly learn to associate novel acoustic stimuli with food rewards. It is unknown how this learning ability is related to foraging behavior in the wild where prey and the calls that identify them vary over space and time. In two bat populations that differ in available prey species (Soberania, Panama, and La Selva, Costa Rica), we presented wild-caught bats with frog calls, katydid calls, and control stimuli. Bats in Soberania were significantly more responsive to complex calls and choruses of the tA(0)ngara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, than were bats in La Selva. La Selva bats were significantly more responsive to katydid calls (Steirodon sp.) than Soberania bats. We also examined seasonal variation in bat response to prey cues. Bats were captured in Soberania in dry and wet seasons and presented with the calls of a dry season breeding frog (Smilisca sila), a wet season breeding frog (P. pustulosus), and four katydid species. Bats captured in the dry season were significantly more responsive to the calls of S. sila than bats captured in the wet season, but there were no seasonal differences in response to the calls of P. pustulosus or the katydid calls.

"100","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In this work we analyse the performance of advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) phased array type L-band syntetic aperture radar (PALSAR) images for mapping and monitoring of very slow landslides using conventional differential interferometry in the Tena Valley (Central Pyrenees, Spain). These results are compared with those retrieved in previous works where multi-band advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) analysis was performed for the same area using PSI techniques. The study area is largely underlain by slates (ca. 80 %) where large deep-seated very slow earth flows are dominant. The results reveal that DInSAR analysis is able to measure displacements of landslides with a greater spatial coverage than PSI analysis, but for a lower amount of them (nine against 51). Overall, the combination of the DInSAR and multi-band PSI analysis permitted to map and monitor 68 % of the landslides in Tena Valley. From this amount, 63 landslides are considered as active. The main advantage of DInSAR with respect to PSI analysis is the capability to detect faster movements (up to 145 cm year(-1)) derived from the 46 days interferograms. That is the case of Sextas and La Selva landslides where an acceleration of the moving mass was measured after intense rainfall periods producing major damages to linear infrastructures. The combination of measured displacement from ALOS interferograms, with the observed damages on the A-136 road, was useful to assess the potential damage that could cause these slow movements. In general, it is demonstrated that even though PSI analysis provides a better performance in terms of landslide mapping, L-band DInSAR analysis provides an added value for landslide hazard assessment through radar remote sensing. For this reason it is necessary to encourage the launch of new satellite missions similar to ALOS PALSAR that could operate with shorter revisiting time periods.","Garcia-Davalillo, Juan

Aposematic dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid-based chemical defenses from a diet of arthropods, but research on these defenses has been limited to adults. Herein, we investigate chemical defense across development in a dendrobatid frog, Oophaga pumilio. This species displays complex parental care: at hatching, mothers transport tadpoles to phytotelmata, and then return to supply them with an obligate diet of nutritive eggs for about six weeks. We collected eggs, tadpoles, juveniles, and adults of O. pumilio, and detected alkaloids in all life stages. The quantity and number of alkaloids increased with frog and tadpole size. We did not detect alkaloids in the earliest stage of tadpoles, but alkaloids were detected as trace quantities in nutritive eggs and as small quantities in ovarian eggs. Tadpoles hand-reared with eggs of an alkaloid-free heterospecific frog did not contain alkaloids. Alkaloids that are sequestered from terrestrial arthropods were detected in both adults and phytotelm-dwelling tadpoles that feed solely on nutritive eggs, suggesting that this frog may be the first animal known to actively provision post-hatch offspring with chemical defenses. Finally, we provide experimental evidence that maternally derived alkaloids deter predation of tadpoles by a predatory arthropod.","Stynoski, Jennifer L.

Though attractants are sometimes used in such surveys, there have not been any evaluations of the effectiveness of common visual and olfactory attractants in field settings. As part of a medium and large mammal camera survey in the San Juan - La Selva Biological Corridor, Costa Rica, we integrated camera trap data within an occupancy modelling framework to estimate the effects of hanging compact disks (visual), cologne (olfactory), and sardines in oil (olfactory) on ocelot detection probabilities. Compact disks appeared to have the most information-theoretic model support, whereas cologne received less model support. The use of compact disks in surveys was also less time-consuming and less expensive than the olfactory attractants. Ocelots are visual hunters and using visual attractants can increase detection probabilities and therefore reduce uncertainty and/or reduce survey effort to obtain robust population or occupancy estimates, although using cologne might also have similar effects. Depending on logistic constraints, we recommend employing several attractants as the most appropriate way to survey ocelots and other rare felids in the future when detection biases are assumed to be strong, particularly as part of mammal community surveys.","Cove, Michael

We studied the communal roosts of two undescribed species of harvestmen in the genus Prionostemma Pocock 1903 at a Caribbean rainforest site in southeastern Nicaragua. The species are quite similar in gross morphology but differ in body coloration, male genitalia, and roosting behavior. One species roosts primarily on spiny palms while the other species, which is darker in coloration, roosts inside buttress root cavities. In a mark-recapture study, the cavity-roosting species had higher levels of individual site fidelity than found previously in the spiny palm-roosting species, perhaps because suitable cavities are scarcer than spiny palms. The tree cavity aggregations were strongly male-biased, which our review of the literature suggests is unusual for harvestman roosts. The overall sex ratio of the spiny palm aggregations was 1:1, but some roost sites were strongly male biased while others were strongly female biased. Removing all harvestmen from 10 spiny palm roost sites shifted the overall sex ratio toward males on subsequent days, but the sites with skewed sex ratios remained skewed in the same directions despite complete turnover in roost membership. These results are discussed in relation to mechanisms of roost formation and possible sex differences in vagility, microhabitat preferences and sensitivity to disturbance. Both species also occur at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica but neither forms roosting aggregations in spiny palms or tree cavities there. A possible explanation for the geographic variation is that roosting patterns change over time through cultural drift.","Grether, Gregory F.

This is only the second report of an association between the nematode suborder Tylenchina and the sycones of figs. Previous reports of most nematode associates of the sycones of figs have been from the lumen and involved transmission by female fig wasp pollinators (Agaonidae) during pollination/oviposition (e.g., Schistonchus and Parasitodiplogaster spp.). The association between F. laselvae n. sp. and Ficus colubrinae may involve an invertebrate host, but none was recovered from dissections of the bracts during this study. It is also possible that this is a rainforest understory nematode that feeds ectoparasitically in protected areas on the aerial parts of F. colubrinae. Molecular analysis using near-full-length sequences of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA and D2-D3 expansion segments of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA genes of Ficotylus laselvae n. sp. suggests that it is a member of the suborder Tylenchina (infraorder: Tylenchomorpha; family: Anguinidae) and that the closest sequenced species is F. congestae from the lumen of sycones of Ficus congesta from Queensland, Australia. Although both nematode species are associated with figs, they are morphologically divergent, suggesting that the different micro-niches that they fill provide different selective pressures for evolution of differing morphological characters or they represent different life history morphotypes of a dicyclic genus.","Giblin-Davis, Robin M.

The SCHA.DIF.3K regional archaeomagnetic model and the secular variation curve for the Iberian Peninsula were used. Three sites (Vil.la de Barenys, La Buada and Collet de Sant Antoni) produced typologically datable artifacts and the archaeomagnetic-direction dating of their kilns agrees roughly with the archaeological ages. Two kilns, at Sota la Timba del Castellot (TC) and Riera de la Selva (RS) appeared isolated lacking of datable artefacts and their archaeomagnetic directions bring important information on their age. For example, the result at RS could be an evidence of the survival of kilns of Roman type (Cuomo di Caprio II/c or Le Ny IIF) up to late Antiquity. Archaeointensities were also obtained for two kilns (La Buada and TC), the first is a datum that can be used as a reference point to improve the description of the archaeointensity variation during Roman times and the latter was used to constrain further the age of kiln TC and confirming its Antique age.

Top-down interaction strength may be influenced by the biotic and abiotic context, including the presence of vegetation-disturbing animals. We tested two hypotheses: (1) insectivorous birds and bats initiate trophic cascades in tropical rain-forest understorey; and (2) the native, omnivorous collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) negates these cascades via non-trophic effects. We studied the top-down effects of birds and bats on understorey plants in north-eastern Costa Rica using 60 netted exclosures within and outside existing peccary exclosures. Excluding birds and bats increased total arthropod densities by half, both with and without peccaries. Bird/bat exclosures increased Diptera density by 28% and leaf damage by 24% without peccaries, consistent with a trophic cascade. However, bird/bat exclosures decreased Diptera density by 32% and leaf damage by 34% with peccaries, a negation of the trophic cascade. Excluding peccaries increased leaf damage by 43% on plants without birds and bats. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that the non-trophic activity of an omnivorous ungulate can reverse a trophic cascade.","Michel, Nicole L.

Endophytes were isolated from every individual plant and were similarly abundant and diverse in frond blades and stalks, in different vegetation types, in epiphytic vs. terrestrial species, and between sampling years. However, abundance, diversity and community structure differed significantly among fern species, and composition differed markedly between sampling years. Phylogenetic classification using separate and combined datasets revealed that as for many Neotropical angiosperms, the majority (95%) of endophyte taxa were Ascomycota, with particular dominance by Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes.

Like other woody lianas, seedlings germinate in the shaded forest understory and start climbing towards the canopy, being exposed to sites with extreme differences in light conditions. However, the extent of physiological and structural adjustment to contrasting light conditions in the early regeneration stages of Gnetum is unknown. To answer this question, we analyzed seedling growth and photosynthetic responses using a common garden experiment with two light regimes: full sun and low light (20% of full sun) at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We also characterized the germination pattern of this species. We monitored one and half-month old seedlings for four months. Leaf structure finely adapted to light treatments, but gas exchange properties were buffered by large seed reserves, which dominated biomass distribution (about 50% of the total biomass), followed by stem (27%), leaf (16%) and root biomass (6%) across light conditions. The presence of large seeds and the low photosynthetic rates of seedlings in both environments show that G. leyboldii is specialized to exploit deep shade. More research is needed to determine if the patterns found in G. leyboldii are typical of similar lianas that initially exploit deep-shaded understories in their accession to the canopy.","Celis, Gerardo

However, likely responses of tropical rainforests are poorly understood due to a lack of frequent long-term measurements of forest structure and dynamics. We analyzed a 12-year record (1999-2010) of 47817 annual measurements of canopy height to characterize the response of an old-growth Neotropical rainforest to the severe heat and drought associated with the 1997-1998 El Nino. Well-drained soils on slopes and plateaus experienced a threefold increase in the fraction of the landscape in gaps (2m) and a reduction in the fraction in high canopy (>15m) causing distributions of canopy height to depart from equilibrium for a period of 2-3years. In contrast, forests on low-lying alluvial terraces remained in equilibrium and were nearly half as likely to experience upper canopy (>15m) disturbance over the 12years of observation. Variation in forest response across topographic positions suggests that tropical rainforests are more sensitive to moisture deficits than high temperature and that topography likely structures landscape-level variation in the severity of drought impacts.","Silva, Carlos E.

Traditionally, characteristics of the dispersal target sites that could increase survivorship of the dispersed plants are thought to be intrinsic to the sites. If directed dispersal is constant over extended periods of time, however, it is likely that nonrandom patterns of dispersal could modify the ecological characteristics of the target site in ways that could increase survivorship and fitness of the dispersed plants. Here we report patterns of Piper diversity (richness, equitability, and similarity) and Piper folivory within plots near natural or artificial roosts of Carollia perspicillata vs. similar plots without bat roosts. Plots with bat roosts, both natural and artificial, had significantly higher Piper species diversity. Additionally, we found that plots with a higher Piper species diversity showed less specialist folivory, higher generalist folivory, and lower total herbivore leaf damage than plots with low Piper diversity. Finally, plots with bat roosts also showed less specialist folivory, lower generalist folivory, and lower total folivory when compared to plots without roosts. We propose that long-lasting nonrandom patterns of seed dispersal can change the local ecological characteristics of target sites via changes in plant diversity, and that these changes are likely to reduce the local rates of folivory and, therefore, increase seed and adult plant survivorship","Salazar, Diego

However, pollen transfer is often asymmetric, with one floral morph acting as a pollen donor and the other as a pollen recipient. We evaluated the association between floral morphology, pollinator visitation and effectiveness on patterns of pollen transfer in distylous Palicourea tetragona at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. To assess floral variation we measured corolla, pistil and stamen traits from 66 plants. We quantified pollinator visitation and efficiency on 56 individuals and counted pollen loads on stigmas of flowers observed for 1 h. We determined fruit set 2 molater and assessed between-morph variation in pollen transfer and female reproductive success. Floral variation was mostly consistent with a typical distylous system; however, there was overlap in the stigma heights of pin and thrum individuals in the study population. Primary pollinators were two species of hawkmoths that visited both morphs at a frequency of 2 visits per flower h(-1). The mean number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas was 89 for pin and 153 for thrum individuals. However, loads of illegitimate pollen were higher on stigmas of thrum individuals, while loads of legitimate pollen were higher on stigmas of pin individuals. Consistently, fruit set was higher in pin (31%) than in thrum individuals (22%). High deposition of illegitimate pollen, in addition to the lower female reproductive success in the thrum morph reveal that distyly in P. tetragona does not always prevent sexual interference. We suggest that in long and narrow tubular flowers, like those of P. tetragona, stigma clogging by deposition of self-or same-morph pollen may reduce legitimate fertilization of ovules causing the observed asymmetric fruit set.","Marten-Rodriguez, Silvana

While the dry tropic wetlands had similar sequestration rates (63 +/- A 10 g Cm-2 y(-1) on average), the humid tropic ones differed significantly (P < 0.001), with high rates in a slow-flowing slough (306 +/- A 77 g Cm-2 y(-1)) and low rates in a tropical rain forest depressional wetland (84 +/- A 23 g Cm-2 y(-1)). The carbon accumulating in all of these wetlands was mostly organic (92-100%). These results suggest the importance of differentiating between types of wetland communities and their hydrology when estimating overall rates at which tropical wetlands sequester carbon, and the need to include tropical wetland carbon sequestration in global carbon budgets.","Bernal, Blanca

"115","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","The herpetofauna that inhabits Caribbean Costa Rica has received considerable attention in the last two decades. This assemblage includes a total of 141 species of reptiles and 95 amphibians mostly distributed in tropical wet and moist lowland forests. While most information available came from primary and secondary forest sites, little is known about the amphibians and reptiles that inhabit more open habitats, such as wetlands and swamps. For instances, swaps dominated by the yolillo palm Raphia taedigera extend through much of the northeastern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and eastern Nicaragua, but information about the herpetological community that uses such environments remains practically unknown. This situation reflects the little research conducted in such inhospitable environments. Here, we report the results of an intensive survey conducted to assess the herpetological community that inhabit R. taedigera palm-swamps. A-total of 14 species of amphibians and 17 of reptiles have been recorded from these swamps. Amphibians and reptiles that inhabit yolillo swamps have wide distributions along much of Middle America and are considered common species throughout their range. In general, yolillo swamps are poor environments for herpetofauna: richness of reptiles and amphibians is almost two times higher in the adjacent forest than in the palm dominated swamps. Furthermore, most species observed in this swamps can be considered habitat generalists that are well adapted to the extreme conditions imposed by the changes in hydroperiods, reduce understory cover, low tree diversity and simple forest architecture of these environments. Despite similarities in the herpetofauna, it is clear that not all forest species use yolillo habitat, a characteristic that is discussed in terms of physical stress driven by the prolonged hydroperiod and reduced leaflitter in the ground, as these features drive habitat structure and herpetofaunal complexity. Our list of species using yolillo swamps is not definitive, and is likely to grow as more studies are conducted in this unexplored environment.","Bonilla-Murillo, Fabian

Our current application concerns analysis of soil nutrients data collected at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, where inferential interest lies in capturing the spatially varying relationships among the nutrients. The objective here is to interpolate not just the nutrients across space, but also associations among the nutrients that are posited to vary spatially. This requires spatially varying cross-covariance models. Fully process-based specifications using matrix-variate processes are theoretically attractive but computationally prohibitive. Here we develop fully process-based low-rank but non-degenerate spatially varying cross-covariance processes that can effectively yield interpolate cross-covariances at arbitrary locations. We show how a particular low-rank process, the predictive process, which has been widely used to model large geostatistical datasets, can be effectively deployed to model non-degenerate cross-covariance processes. We produce substantive inferential tools such as maps of nonstationary cross-covariances that constitute the premise of further mechanistic modeling and have hitherto not been easily available for environmental scientists and ecologists.","Guhaniyogi, Rajarshi

The development of management and conservation practices for this species requires understanding of its population structure, dynamics, and traditional use across the range of environments it inhabits, from different successional stages in continuous forest to forest fragments. Here, we analyzed how the population structure of E. precatoria varies with successional stage, fragmentation, and exposure to extraction. Since E. precatoria recruitment increases with disturbance, we expected seedling density to be higher in secondary forests and fragments relative to primary forests. The study was conducted from 2007-2008 in the Caribbean Slope of Costa Rica at Braulio Carrillo National Park (BCNP), La Selva Biological Station (LSBS), Mann Center, and Finca El Progreso (FEP). The first two sites had continuous primary and secondary forests (BCNP had one extracted primary forest); the last two consisted of primary forest fragments. Population structure was variable, with greater densities in the extracted primary forest, and in the secondary forests, as compared to primary forests and fragments. Palms <5m across all sites represented 50-90% of the total number of individuals. In sites that suffered historical over-extraction, local communities have lost the tradition of consuming this species. Understanding how population dynamics is affected by extraction and succession is essential to the design of sustainable management programs rooted in community participation.","Avalos, Gerardo

"118","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Many functional properties of forests depend on the leaf area; however, measuring leaf area is not trivial in tall evergreen vegetation. As a result, leaf area is generally estimated indirectly by light absorption methods. These indirect methods are widely used, but have never been calibrated against direct measurements in tropical rain forests, either at point or landscape scales. Here, we compare direct harvest leaf area index (LAI) measurements taken across an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape with data from two indirect methods, digital hemispherical photography and the LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Direct measurements of leaf area were done by collecting all leaf material within an area of 4.6 m(2), extending from the forest floor to the top of the canopy using a portable aluminum scaffolding tower. The tower was erected at 45 locations following a stratified random design.
Mean direct-harvest LAI above 1 m was 5.5 +/- 03 SE. Plant area index (PAI, leaves + wood) was 5.1 +/- 0.2 for the LAI-2000, and for the hemispherical photographs was 3.9 +/- 0.2, analyzed using Gap Light Analyzer (CIA), and 4.9-6.0 +/- 0.2 using WinSCANOPY software. Correction for leaf clumping (non-random distribution of leaves) generally improved LAI estimates of the hemispherical photographs. At the local scale, direct-harvest LAI was not significantly correlated with LAI estimates for either indirect method. However, correlations between direct-harvest LAI and both indirect methods along vertical canopy transects from forest floor to the canopy top were significant. Relationships between harvest LAI and canopy closure (from which indirect LAI values are derived) showed very small changes in closure with large changes in LAI at LAI values >6, indicating that the estimations of LAI using canopy closure values were reaching an asymptote. As a result, at high canopy closure indirect LAI is underestimated. Overall, the LAI-2000 performed better than hemispherical photography for estimating direct-harvest LAI at landscapes scales. However, with corrections for leaf clumping, hemispherical photography can be effective for estimating and characterizing landscape level LAI of tropical rain forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, we conducted walking surveys for 2 years to study the behavior and population trends of collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu), and found that peccaries are abundant at La Selva Biological Station and overall, detection rates were relatively constant through time. A stable estimate of detection rates was achieved only after 7-9 months of surveying. We found no habitat preferences between primary and secondary forest, yet there were some differences in group dynamics group radius was larger and sighting distance was greater in primary forest, whereas the number of singletons was higher in secondary forest. More peccaries were seen closer to the laboratory clearing than at greater distances, for a variety of probable reasons: habituation to humans, lower predation and hunting pressure, and various environmental and habitat factors. Peccary groups had spatially clumped distributions across the landscape and were more active diurnally than nocturnally. Collared peccary densities are relatively high at La Selva compared to other Neotropical sites, with the exception of Barro Colorado Island. We combined our data with a review of the historical literature to assess changes in the populations of peccaries in the Caribbean lowlands. We found that collared peccaries have likely increased in abundance at La Selva, seemingly a few years after the extirpation of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecan), which were abundant in the area 40-50 years ago. An understanding of the group dynamics, behavior, and habitat preference of collared peccaries is essential for management decisions and conservation efforts. Additionally, assessment of population changes should be carefully considered in a historical context, with a particular focus on how the populations of the 2 peccary species have changed, and how these species might differentially affect their environment.","Romero, Andrea

Here, we measured the species richness, abundance, and community composition of amphibians and reptiles in reference primary forest and mono-dominant plantations of three native tree species (Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, Vochysia guatemalensis) at La Selva Biological Station in the Caribbean lowlands of northern Costa Rica. Because these plantation species generate markedly different forest-floor habitats, we hypothesized that tree species would support different assemblages of leaf-litter herpetofauna. Primary forest, Virola, and Vochysia supported greater richness of frogs than Pentaclethra. Frog densities were significantly lower in Pentaclethra and Vochysia than in nearby primary forest. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance, we found Pentaclethra to support significantly different assemblages of frogs and lizards than primary forest reference sites, while Vochysia supported a unique assemblage of frogs. Our results suggest that some tree species plantations can support herpetofaunal assemblages comparable to primary forest in richness, community assembly, and abundance. While herpetofaunal community ecology varies among plantation species, our study provides a compelling example of how plantation landscapes can facilitate the restoration of native fauna on degraded landscapes.","Folt, Brian

"123","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Predation is one of the major selective agents influencing evolution of color patterns. Cryptic color patterns decrease detection probability by predators, but their concealing function depends on the background against which patterns are seen; therefore, habitat use and color patterns are tightly linked. In many anole species, females exhibit variation in dorsal color patterns; the drab and perhaps cryptic colors of the patterns suggest a predator avoidance function behind this polymorphism. We tested whether these different color patterns experience different predation rates depending on their micro-habitat. We expected each pattern to form at least one optimal combination with a typically used micro-habitat that would result in lower predation compared to other morphs in the same micro-habitat. We tested this hypothesis for anoles at La Selva, Costa Rica, using clay models resembling a common species at this site: Norops humilis. The first experiment tested for variation in predation on various substrates. We included leaf litter, live leaves, and two size classes of woody stems, using 44 models for each pattern substrate combination. A second experiment tested effects of perch height (10 and 60cm) and diameter (<2cm and >5cm), with 50 models for each pattern perch combination. We found differences in predation rates between the morphs depending on their micro-habitat. Specifically, the striped morph had a significant advantage over the others on green leaves. In the second experiment, striped morphs showed significantly lower predation on low than on high perches, irrespective of perch diameter. Reticulated models had an advantage over other morphs on thin stems for the first experiment, where models were placed about 60cm high. Diameter did not have a significant effect on predation for reticulated morphs when height classes were combined. Dotted models did not experience an advantage over the other morphs in any of the treatments. In leaf litter and on thick perches no morph had any advantage over another, and leaf litter predation rates were generally low. These results support a role for predation in maintaining multiple female morphs within small Costa Rican anoles, such as N. humilis.","Paemelaere, Evi A. D.

One current hypothesis is that CO2 fertilization has been increasing tropical forest productivity. Some lines of evidence instead suggest climate-driven productivity declines. Relevant direct field observations remain extremely limited for this biome. Using a unique long-term record of annual field measurements, we assessed annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and its relation to climatic factors and [CO2] in a neotropical rainforest through 1997-2009. Over this 12 year period, annual productivity did not increase, as would be expected with a dominant CO2 fertilization effect. Instead, the negative responses of ANPP components to climatic stress far exceeded the small positive responses associated with increasing [CO2]. Annual aboveground biomass production was well explained (73%) by the independent negative effects of increasing minimum temperatures and greater dry-season water stress. The long-term records enable a first field-based estimate of the [CO2] response of tropical forest ANPP: 5.24 g m(-2) yr(-1) yr(-1) (the summed [CO2]-associated increases in two of the four production components; the largest component, leaf litterfall, showed no [CO2] association). If confirmed by longer data series, such a small response from a fertile tropical rainforest would indicate that current global models overestimate the benefits from CO2 fertilization for this biome, where most forests' poorer nutrient status more strongly constrains productivity responses to increasing [CO2]. Given the rapidly intensifying warming across tropical regions, tropical forest productivity could sharply decline through coming decades.","Clark, Deborah A.

Coati groups consist of adult females and juveniles of both sexes until male juveniles reach two years of age and leave the band to become solitary. Adult males only tolerate juveniles for a brief period during breeding season when the males court females to mate. Outside of the breeding season, adult males are known to prey on juveniles. In this study, when adult males were present with the band, play occurred more than was expected by chance, and adult males engaged in many of these play bouts.

Over an 8-yr period (19992007), we censused lianas in nine, 24x36m permanent plots in old-growth and selectively logged forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica to test whether: (1) liana abundance and basal area are increasing in this forest; (2) the increase is being driven by increased recruitment, decreased mortality, or both; and (3) long-distance clonal colonization explains the increase in liana abundance and basal area. We defined long-distance clonal colonization as lianas that entered and rooted in the plots as vegetative propagules of stems that originated from outside or above the plot, and were present in 2007, but not in 1999 or 2002. Our hypotheses were supported in the old-growth forest: mean liana abundance and BA (1cm diameter) increased 15 and 20 percent, respectively, and clonal colonization from outside of the plots contributed 19 and 60 percent (respectively) to these increases. Lianas colonized clonally by falling vertically from the forest canopy above or growing horizontally along the forest floor and re-rootingcommon forms of colonization for many liana species. In the selectively logged forest, liana abundance and BA did not change, and thus the pattern of increasing lianas may be restricted to old-growth forests. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that lianas are increasing in old-growth forests, and that long-distance clonal colonization is a major contributor.","Yorke, Suzanne R.

Variable concentrations of dissolved Sr2+ and Ca2+ in the catchments are related to mixing of waters from different origin. Three catchments are influenced by high-solute bedrock groundwater, while another catchment is primarily supplied by local recharge. Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were employed to discriminate contributions from mineral weathering and atmospheric sources. Solutes in bedrock groundwater have a predominant geogenic origin, whereas local recharge is characterized by low-solute inputs from rainwater and minor in situ weathering releases from nutrient-depleted soils. Bedrock groundwater contributes more than 60% of dissolved Sr2+ to surface discharge in the Salto, Saltito, and Arboleda catchments, whereas the Taconazo catchment receives more than 95% of dissolved Sr2+ from rainwater. delta Ca-44/46 values of dissolved Ca2+ vary greatly in the catchments, mainly as a result of heterogeneous Ca isotope compositions of the contributing sources. Based on differences in delta Ca-44/40 values, two distinct bedrock groundwaters discharging at the Salto and the Arboleda catchments are suggested. Effects of biological processes in the plant-soil system on solute generation in the catchments are indicated by variable Ca/Sr ratios. However, these effects cannot clearly be assessed by Ca isotopes due to the strong heterogeneity of delta Ca-44/40 values of Ca2+ sources and high Ca2+ concentrations in bedrock groundwater.

We studied hydrogen stable isotope ratios of body water (delta H-2(BW)) and fur keratin in 36 bat species (>400 individuals) from a tropical forest assemblage to evaluate if delta H-2(BW) and delta H-2(K) are related to body size, trophic position, and movement ecology. We found a relatively large range of delta H-2(BW) values (similar to 65 parts per thousand) across bat species. Our phylogenetically controlled analysis showed that delta H-2(BW) was not related to body size, trophic position, or movement ecology of species. The analysis also indicated that delta H-2(BW) of primary consumers (i.e., fruit-eating bats) was similar to that of fruit juice, and delta H-2(BW) of secondary consumers (i.e., animalivorous bats) was similar to that of surface water. Across bat species, delta H-2(K) tended to decrease with increasing delta H-2(BW), suggesting that delta H-2(K) is not directly linked to delta H-2(BW). We further tested whether delta H-2(K) varied with a species' trophic position (measured as delta N-15) and movement ecology (local or regional species). In syntopic bats, delta H-2(K) ranged over 73 parts per thousand, yet delta H-2(K) was related neither to delta N-15 nor to the movement ecology of species. Fur keratin of secondary consumers was more enriched in H-2 by 44 parts per thousand and in N-15 by 3.7 parts per thousand compared with fur keratin of primary consumers. In an intraspecific analysis, we found that delta H-2(K) of an insectivorous bat varied by 20 parts per thousand between colonies at 4 km distance. Within this species, delta H-2(K) was not related to individual delta N-15 and body mass. Our data suggest that variation in delta H-2(K) can be large in bats of tropical assemblages, both across species (range; 70 parts per thousand) and even within sedentary species (range; 20 parts per thousand), and that delta H-2(K) is largely affected by the dietary habits of species.","Voigt, Christian C.

"131","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Research into the buffering mechanisms and ecological consequences of acidification in tropical streams is lacking. We have documented seasonal and episodic acidification events in streams draining La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Across this forested landscape, the severity in seasonal and episodic acidification events varies due to interbasin groundwater flow (IGF). Streams that receive IGF have higher concentrations of solutes and more stable pH (similar to 6) than streams that do not receive IGF (pH similar to 5). To examine the buffering capacity and vulnerability of macroinvertebrates to short-term acidification events, we added hydrochloric acid to acidify a low-solute, poorly buffered (without IGF) and a high-solute, well buffered stream (with IGF). We hypothesized that: 1) protonation of bicarbonate (HCO3-) would neutralize most of the acid added in the high-solute stream, while base cation release from the sediments would be the most important buffering mechanism in the low-solute stream; 2) pH declines would mobilize inorganic aluminum (Ali) from sediments in both streams; and 3) pH declines would increase macroinvertebrate drift in both streams. We found that the high-solute stream neutralized 745 mu eq/L (96% of the acid added), while the solute poor stream only neutralized 27.4 mu eq/L (40%). Protonation of HCO3- was an important buffering mechanism in both streams. Base cation, Fe2+, and Ali release from sediments and protonation of organic acids also provided buffering in the low-solute stream. We measured low concentrations of Ali release in both streams (2-9 mu eq/L) in response to acidification, but the low-solute stream released double the amount Ali per 100 mu eq of acid added than the high solute stream. Macroinvertebrate drift increased in both streams in response to acidification and was dominated by Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae. Our results elucidate the different buffering mechanisms in tropical streams and suggest that low-solute poorly buffered streams might be particularly vulnerable to episodic acidification.

The first step in understanding the mechanisms generating and maintaining this important component of biodiversity is to identify plant-herbivore associations. In this study we determined insect-host plant associations for an entire guild of insect herbivores using plant DNA extracted from insect gut contents. Over two years, in a tropical rain forest in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station), we recorded the full diet breadth of rolled-leaf beetles, a group of herbivores that feed on plants in the order Zingiberales. Field observations were used to determine the accuracy of diet identifications using a three-locus DNA barcode (rbcL, trnH-psbA and ITS2). Using extraction techniques for ancient DNA, we obtained high-quality sequences for two of these loci from gut contents (rbcL and ITS2). Sequences were then compared to a comprehensive DNA barcode library of the Zingiberales. The rbcL locus identified host plants to family (success/sequence = 58.8%) and genus (success/sequence = 47%). For all Zingiberales except Heliconiaceae, ITS2 successfully identified host plants to genus (success/sequence = 67.1%) and species (success/sequence = 61.6%). Kindt's sampling estimates suggest that by collecting ca. four individuals representing each plant-herbivore interaction, 99% of all host associations included in this study can be identified to genus. For plants that amplified ITS2, 99% of the hosts can be identified to species after collecting at least four individuals representing each interaction. Our study demonstrates that host plant identifications at the species-level using DNA barcodes are feasible, cost-effective, and reliable, and that reconstructing plant-herbivore networks with these methods will become the standard for a detailed understanding of these interactions.","Garcia-Robledo, Carlos

This study used camera-traps to survey medium and large mammal diversity in the San Juan - La Selva Biological Corridor, Costa Rica. The connectivity of the corridor is affected by the spread of large-scale agriculture, cattle ranching, and a growing human presence. An occupancy modeling approach was used to estimate corridor species richness and species-specific detection probabilities in 16 forested sites within four different matrix-use categories: eco-lodge reserves, tree plantations/general reforestation, cattle ranches, and pineapple/agricultural plantations. Rarity had a highly negative effect (beta = -1.96 +/- 0.65 SE) on the ability to detect species presence. Corridor richness was estimated at 20.4 +/- 0.66 species and was lower than that observed in protected areas in the Neotropics. Forest cover was significantly less at pineapple plantations than other land-use matrices. Richness estimates for different land-use matrices were highly variable with no significant differences; however, pineapple plantations exhibited the highest observed richness. Given the limited forest cover at those sites, we believe that this reflects the concentrated occurrence of medium and large mammals in small forest patches, particularly because the majority of pineapple plantation communities were generalist mesopredators. Fragmentation and connectivity will need to be addressed with reforestation and limitations on pineapple production for the region to function as an effective corridor. Occupancy modeling has only recently been applied to camera-trap data and our results suggest that this approach provides robust richness and detection probability estimates and should further explored.","Cove, Michael V.

At La Selva Biological Station in the Sarapiqui region of Costa Rica, shrimp population data were collected between 1988 and 1989, before massive land-use change occurred downstream that could potentially affect shrimp recruitment upstream. Using generalized linear models and a Bayesian inference framework, the relative abundance of Macrobrachium olfersi between recent (2008-2011) and historical time periods (1988-1989) was compared in three stream reaches. Shrimp relative abundance in two stream reaches within the protected area of La Selva was relatively constant yearly and between recent post-disturbance (2008-2011) and historical pre-disturbance (1988-89) time periods. In contrast, a stream reach bordered by pasture accessible to fishermen, showed an 87% decrease in relative abundance between recent and historical time periods suggesting site-level disturbance, possibly from fishing. The lack of change between historical and contemporary sampling periods within interior-forest stream reaches suggests that shrimp populations in protected forested reaches are resistant or resilient to certain land-use changes occurring downstream.","Snyder, Marcia N.

We then used the LIDAR-derived metrics to predict acoustic diversity across the forest landscape. Sound recordings were obtained from 14 sites for six consecutive days during dusk chorus (6 pm). Acoustic diversity was calculated for each day as the total intensity across acoustic frequency bands using the Shannon index and then averaged over the 6 days at each site. A 10 m radius around each site was used to obtain several LIDAR-derived metrics describing the vertical structural attributes of the forest canopy. Multiple linear regression (MLR) with Akaike information criterion was used to determine a top-ranked model with acoustic diversity as the dependent variable and the LIDAR metrics as independent variables. Acoustic diversity was modeled for forested areas (where canopy height was > 20 m) at 20 m resolution using coefficients obtained from the MLR, and a hotspot analysis was conducted on the resulting layer. Acoustic diversity was strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.75) with the LIDAR metrics suggesting that LIDAR-derived metrics can be used to determine canopy structural attributes important to vocal fauna species. The hotspot analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of these canopy structural attributes across the La Selva forest is not random. Our approach can be used to identify forest patches of potentially high acoustic diversity for conservation or management purposes.","Pekin, Burak K.

In the Neotropics, most amphibian declines have occurred in cool mid- to high-elevation sites (> 400 m asl), and it is hypothesized that high temperatures limit the growth of Bd in lowland tropical sites, despite few data available on the distribution of Bd in lowland forests. Here, we report the results of a 12-mo pathogen surveillance program for three common species of frogs at a warm lowland site in northeastern Costa Rica. We combine standard non-invasive skin swabbing techniques with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay to analyze the infection prevalence and Bd load across a 1-yr period. Our data indicate an overall Bd infection rate of 6.1 percent, but prevalence varies from < 5 percent in warmer months to a peak of 34.7 percent in the coolest months of the year. Despite very little seasonal variation in temperature (< 4 degrees C), our data indicate strong seasonal variation in the prevalence of Bd, with highest prevalence of infection in months with coolest air temperatures. While it has been suggested that Bd is primarily a riparian fungus, we find no difference in prevalence of infection among our species despite considerable differences in affiliation of these species with water. Our study provides further evidence that infection by Bd is regulated by temperature and shows that warm temperatures in lowland forests may restrict, but not prevent, infection by Bd.","Whitfield, Steven M.

Earlier studies that have characterized the association between attine ants and their bacterial symbionts have employed broad phylogenetic approaches, with conclusions ranging from a diffuse coevolved mutualism to no specificity being reported. However, the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution proposes that coevolved interactions likely occur at a level above local populations but within species. Moreover, the scale of population subdivision is likely to impact coevolutionary dynamics. Here, we describe the population structure of bacteria associated with the attine Apterostigma dentigerum across Central America using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of six housekeeping genes. The majority (90%) of bacteria that were isolated grouped into a single clade within the genus Pseudonocardia. In contrast to studies that have suggested that Pseudonocardia dispersal is high and therefore unconstrained by ant associations, we found highly structured (F-ST = 0.39) and dispersalST limited (i.e., significant isolation by distance; r = 0.517, P = .05) populations over even a relatively small scale (e. g., within the Panama Canal Zone). Estimates of recombination versus mutation were uncharacteristically low compared with estimates for free-living Actinobacteria (e. g., rho/theta = 0.028 in La Selva, Costa Rica), which suggests that recombination is constrained by association with ant hosts. Furthermore, Pseudonocardia population structure was correlated with that of Escovopsis species (r = 0.67, P = .02), supporting the bacteria's role in disease suppression. Overall, the population dynamics of symbiotic Pseudonocardia are more consistent with a specialized mutualistic association than with recently proposed models of low specificity and frequent horizontal acquisition.","Caldera, Eric J.

We hypothesized that leafcutter colonies are sodium limited, and that leafcutter ants will therefore forage specifically for sodium. 2. Previous studies demonstrated that leafcutter Atta cephalotes Linnaeus workers preferentially cut and remove paper baits treated with NaCl relative to water control baits. Atta cephalotes colonies in this study were presented with baits offering NaCl, Na2SO4, and KCl to test whether leafcutters forage specifically for sodium. Sucrose and water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. 3. Atta foragers removed significantly more of the baits treated with NaCl and Na2SO4 than the KCl treatment, which did not differ from water.

In this study, we asked how functional traits of adults and saplings within a speciose genus, Inga, differ in relation to their soil-type preferences. 2. We quantified soil-type preference and functional traits of nine Inga species (Fabaceae) in the wet tropical forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, where rich alluvial soil and less fertile residual soil of volcanic origin occur in close proximity. 3. From the extensive trail network, we randomly selected 104 trail segments, each 50m long, along which all Inga individuals >50cm tall were counted and identified to species. Five and three common species showed significant bias to residual or alluvial soil, respectively, while the remaining one showed no significant bias. For these nine species, we quantified five leaf traits for saplings and adults, as well as wood-specific gravity (WSG) and three seed traits. 4. For both adults and saplings, leaf mass per area (LMA) and lamina density were higher for residual-soil specialists than fertile alluvial-soil specialists. The opposite trend was found for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in leaves. Lamina thickness did not differ between soil-type preference groups. All leaf trait values except N concentration increased from saplings to adults, with adults showing larger interspecific variations in trait values than saplings. 5. Saplings and adults of the single species found on both soils had trait values intermediate between residual and alluvial-soil specialists. 6. Seed mass and seed N, as well as WSG of adults, were higher in residual-soil specialists than alluvial-soil specialists. Higher seed N indicates higher maternal investment of species growing on less fertile soil. 7. These differences in traits among closely related species across continuous soils suggest that habitat filtering has contributed to the evolution of seed, juvenile and adult traits within a speciose tropical tree genus.","Palow, Danielle T.

"142","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","The development of a Bayesian modeling approach for estimation of the age distribution of groundwater using radioactive isotopes and anthropogenic chemicals is described. The model considers the uncertainties associated with the measured tracer concentrations as well as the parameters affecting the concentration of tracers in the groundwater, and it provides the posterior probability densities of the parameters defining the groundwater age distribution using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The model also incorporates the effect of dissolution of aquifer minerals on diluting the C-14 signature and the uncertainties associated with this process on the inferred age distribution parameters. Two demonstration modeling cases have been performed. First, the method was applied to simulated tracer concentrations at a discharge point of a hypothetical 2-D vertical aquifer with two recharge zones, leading to a mixed groundwater age distribution under different presumed uncertainties. When the error variance of the observed tracer concentrations is considered unknown, the method can estimate the parameters of the fitted exponential-lognormal distribution with a relatively narrow credible interval when five hypothetical samples are assumed to be collected at the discharge point. However, when a single sample is assumed, the credible intervals become wider, and credible estimations of the parameters are not obtained. Second, the method was applied to the data collected at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. In this demonstration application, nine different forms of presumed groundwater age distributions have been considered, including four single forms and five mixed forms, assuming the groundwater consists of distinct young and old fractions. For the medium geometrical standard deviation delta(c, i) = 1.41, the model estimates a young groundwater age of between 0 and 350 years, with the largest odds being given to a mean age of approximately 100 years, and a fraction of young groundwater of between 15% to roughly 60%, with the largest odds for 30%. However, the method cannot definitively rule out larger fractions of young groundwater. The model provides a much more uncertain estimation of the age of old groundwater, with a credible interval of between 20,000 to 200,000 years.","Massoudieh, Arash

"143","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Large scale diversity patterns are well established for terrestrial macrobiota (e.g. plants and vertebrates), but not for microscopic organisms (e.g. nematodes). Due to small size, high abundance, and extensive dispersal, microbiota are assumed to exhibit cosmopolitan distributions with no biogeographical patterns. This assumption has been extrapolated from local spatial scale studies of a few taxonomic groups utilizing morphological approaches. Recent molecularly-based studies, however, suggest something quite opposite. Nematodes are the most abundant metazoans on earth, but their diversity patterns are largely unknown. We conducted a survey of nematode diversity within three vertical strata (soil, litter, and canopy) of rainforests at two contrasting latitudes in the North American meridian (temperate: the Olympic National Forest, WA, U.S.A and tropical: La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica) using standardized sampling designs and sample processing protocols. To describe nematode diversity, we applied an ecometagenetic approach using 454 pyrosequencing. We observed that: 1) nematode communities were unique without even a single common species between the two rainforests, 2) nematode communities were unique among habitats in both rainforests, 3) total species richness was 300% more in the tropical than in the temperate rainforest, 4) 80% of the species in the temperate rainforest resided in the soil, whereas only 20% in the tropics, 5) more than 90% of identified species were novel. Overall, our data provided no support for cosmopolitanism at both local (habitats) and large (rainforests) spatial scales. In addition, our data indicated that biogeographical patterns typical of macrobiota also exist for microbiota.","Porazinska, Dorota L.

"144","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Diel cycles in stream discharge during baseflow periods in a headwater stream in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, a tropical wet forest site, appear to be associated with groundwater withdrawal by the forest for evapotranspiration (ET). Analysis of the cycles indicates a strong correlation of stage change with ET demand, similar to the variation found in riparian water table elevation by previous researchers. Links between daily forest Er demand cycles and stream discharge cycles have been reported in temperate humid and semi-arid regions, but the frequent flood hydrographs of the wet tropics tend to obscure this daily signal. This study modifies and combines two established empirical methods for analyzing the diel ET signal in streamflow which lead to estimates of riparian Er derived from groundwater (ETG) at hourly time scales and spatial extent of the riparian area. The model has a direct dependence on the estimate of specific yield, a difficult to constrain parameter, which we estimate from previously published soil analyses. For the six baseflow periods analyzed, the model estimates groundwater ET losses ranging from 1.8 to 3.9 mm/day within the riparian area. These estimates are 52-81% of the total ET estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation (ETpm). The signal of ETG in the stream lags ETpm by 1.5-3 h, with apparent peak decay and signal duration lengthening during propagation. Model results indicate that the area of the riparian zone that influences streamflow by means of ET withdrawal increases with stream stage and ranges from 2.5% to 6.6% of the total basin area. Variations in the rate of change of nightly stream stage recovery suggest possible variations in the relative importance of subsurface hydraulic properties. At high stages, the rate of stream stage recovery from ET losses decreases throughout the night, whereas at low stages the rate of stream stage recovery increases throughout the night. Future work with numerical models could explore mechanistic controls on these empirically-derived recovery functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Cadol, Daniel

Instream wood loads in tropical rivers might be expected to differ from those in analogous temperate rivers because of the higher transport capacity and higher rates of wood decay in the tropics. We use data from four field sites in Costa Rica and Panama to demonstrate that wood loads are consistently lower in tropical rivers, despite substantial variations among tropical sites as a result of differences in mechanisms of wood recruitment. We develop a model of wood dynamics (recruitment, transport, and retention) based on differences in dominant wood recruitment mechanism. The steady-state end-member reflects sites where gradual recruitment of wood through individual tree fall creates a relatively consistent wood load through time and development of logjams is minimal. The episodic end-member reflects sites dominated by episodic mass recruitment via landslides or blowdowns. This facilitates formation of transient logjams, so that wood loads exhibit substantial spatial and temporal variation along the channel network. The model presented here should also apply to headwater streams in the temperate zone, although existing documentation suggests that jams are more persistent along streams in the temperate zone.

"146","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","This study explores the potential of waveform lidar in mapping the vertical and spatial distributions of leaf area index (LAI) over the tropical rain forest of La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Vertical profiles of LAI were derived at 0.3 m height intervals from the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data using the Geometric Optical and Radiative Transfer (GORT) model. Cumulative LAI profiles obtained from LVIS were validated with data from 55 ground to canopy vertical transects using a modular field tower to destructively sample all vegetation. Our results showed moderate agreement between lidar and field derived LAI (r(2) = 0.42, RMSE = 1.91, bias = -0.32), which further improved when differences between lidar and tower footprint scales (r(2) = 0.50, RMSE = 1.79, bias = 0.27) and distance of field tower from lidar footprint center (r(2) = 0.63, RMSE = 1.36, bias = 0.0) were accounted for. Next, we mapped the spatial distribution of total LAI across the landscape and analyzed LAI variations over different land cover types. Mean values of total LAI were 1.74, 5.20, 5.41 and 5.62 over open pasture, secondary forests, regeneration forests after selective-logging and old-growth forests respectively. Lastly, we evaluated the sensitivities of our LAI retrieval model to variations in canopy/ground reflectance ratio and to waveform noise such as induced by topographic slopes. We found for both, that the effects were not significant for moderate LAI values (about 4). However model derivations of LAI might be inaccurate in areas of high-slope and high LAI (about 8) if ground return energies are low. This research suggests that large footprint waveform lidar can provide accurate vertical LAI profile estimates that do not saturate even at the high LAI levels in tropical rain forests and may be a useful tool for understanding the light transmittance within these canopies.

Temperate streams affected by anthropogenic acidification have been extensively studied, but our understanding of natural acidification in tropical streams has been constrained by the lack of long-term datasets. Here, we analyze 14 years of monthly observations from 13 sampling stations in eight tropical streams in lowland Costa Rica. Stream pH increased during the 4-month dry season and declined throughout the wet season. The magnitude of the seasonal pH decline was greatest following the driest dry seasons, including the historically large El Nio Southern Oscillation event in 1998 when pH values dropped below 4.0 in some streams. Dissolved CO2 accounts for the low baseline pH in the poorly buffered study streams, and we hypothesize that an influx of soil-derived CO2 via subsurface flow paths contributes to the observed seasonal pH declines. Our results show tight coupling between rainfall, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems in the tropics. Predicted decreases in dry season rainfall for the tropics may lead to an increased magnitude of seasonal acidification.","Small, Gaston E.

Body tissue of litter invertebrates (extracted from leaf-litter samples) along with soil, leaf litter and green foliage were analysed for total C, total N, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures across plots and relative trophic distances of detrital food webs (Delta delta N-15), and their variation with soil P gradient were evaluated. We found soil P gradient had a significantly positive correlation with delta N-15 of Asterogyne martiana foliage, leaf litter, collembolans and oribatid mites. The delta N-15 of the collembolans and pseudoscorpions positively correlated to leaf-litter delta N-15. Delta delta N-15 between the trophic levels remained consistent across the soil P gradient. Higher delta N-15 in the collembolans and oribatid mites might be derived from their consumption on N-15-enriched decayed debris or fungal hyphae growing on it. It suggests that fine-scale soil P variation can affect trophic dynamics of detrital arthropods via regulation of microbial community and nutrient dynamics.","Huang, Ching-Yu

Because nitrogen (N) cycling is inextricably linked with C cycling, the question becomes: Where does the N come from to match high rates of C accumulation? In unique experimental 16-y-old plantations established in abandoned pasture in lowland Costa Rica, we used a mass-balance approach to quantify N accumulation in vegetation, identify sources of N, and evaluate differences among tree species in N cycling. The replicated design contained four broad-leaved evergreen tree species growing under similar environmental conditions. Nitrogen uptake was rapid, reaching 409 (+/- 30) kg.ha(-1).y(-1), double the rate reported from a Puerto Rican forest and greater than four times that observed at Hubbard Brook Forest (New Hampshire, USA). Nitrogen amassed in vegetation was 874 (+/- 176) kg.ha(-1), whereas net losses of soil N (0-100 cm) varied from 217 (+/- 146) to 3,354 (+/- 915) kg.ha(-1) (P = 0.018) over 16 y. Soil C:N, delta C-13 values, and N budgets indicated that soil was the main source of biomass N. In Vochysia guatemalensis, however, N fixation contributed >60 kg.ha(-1).y(-1). All species apparently promoted soil N turnover, such that the soil N mean residence time was 32-54 y, an order of magnitude lower than the global mean. High rates of N uptake were associated with substantial N losses in three of the species, in which an average of 1.6 g N was lost for every gram of N accumulated in biomass.","Russell, Ann E.

Here, we present the first examination of growth habit and gametophyte morphology for this species. We show that the cordate to elongate-cordate gametophytes occur up to 0.5 m above the ground on the base of tree trunks. Unlike the gametophytes of all other studied species of Elaphoglossum, rhizoids are absent along the thallus margin and the hairs present on the margin lack whitish waxy caps; both differences are pleisiomorphic for the genus. Sporelings of E. amygdalifolium produce a single long root that grows straight into the soil where it branches profusely. Mature sporophytes have long-creeping rhizomes that climb to heights of at least 3 m and produce two types of roots: ""feeding roots"" that reach the ground and ""clasping roots"" that anchor the sporophyte to its host plant. Our observations reveal that E. amygdalifolium is a primary hemiepiphyte, the first example of this growth habit to be documented in Elaphoglossum.

"153","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Tropical forest productivity is widely assumed to be limited by soil phosphorus (P), but biogeochemical processes that deplete P also could deplete base cations, suggesting multiple resource limitation. Limitation by several resources could arise from species and functional diversity and from variation among groups in resource requirements, including ecophysiological strategies that minimize P limitation. We hypothesized that tree growth is positively related to soil base cation and P availability and negatively related to local competition; Fabaceae growth is weakly correlated with soil resources if fixed N is used indirectly to acquire other resources; growth of species with low wood density is more strongly related to soil resource availability than that of species with high wood density. Diameter growth and soil resource availability were measured in five mapped stands situated across natural soil resource gradients in lowland wet tropical forest (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica). Soil resource availability, and associated uncertainty, was estimated for each tree using a Bayesian multivariate spatial regression model, with individual tree growth being a function of diameter, local neighborhood, and soil resources. Separately, site-level mean tree growth and resource availability were modeled using linear regression. Individual diameter growth and site mean basal area increment correlated with soil base cations and P, but rarely with N; individual growth correlated negatively with neighborhood index for only three species. Growth of Fabaceae was unrelated to soil resources at both individual and site levels. When species were categorized by wood density, growth was related to soil P or base cation availability, with the strongest correlation between the lowest-density species and soil P. Several resources may limit tropical forest productivity, because tree growth was similarly correlated with soil P and base cations, but functional groups responded differently. Negligible growth relationships with soil resources in Fabaceae suggest that N fixation may alleviate mineral nutrient limitations. Correlations of soil P with growth of species of low wood density and base cations with species of higher density suggests variation in resource demands among functional groups. Thus, tropical tree growth may be limited by base cations and/or P, with degree and type of resource limitation dependent on functional or taxonomic group.","Baribault, Thomas W.

The soil closest to the Pentaclethra macroloba trees (""tree soil"") had a lower abundance of the N-fixing bacteria Frankia, but greater amounts of both nifH gene and Rhizobium than soils furthest away (""forest soils""). These soils also had greater amounts of microbial biomass and were more efficient at organic carbon use as indicated by lower metabolic quotient values (qCO(2)). This suggests that the use of Pentaclethra macroloba in restoration of soils from harvested forests may provide a good strategy for recuperating nitrogen in the soils due to its association with N-fixing bacteria near the roots of the trees and in the nearby soils. As well, these trees were associated with enhanced microbial biomass, microbial activity, and microbial mediated enhanced efficiency of C use into the biomass, suggesting their value in improving soil richness. A tangential discovery during this study was that it was the first, to our knowledge to show the presence of Frankia in association with Pentaclethra macroloba. It is interesting to note that significant amounts of Frankia were found throughout the soils in this study, and it was present in all sites at levels far greater than Rhizobium. It is likely that Frankia is more critical in recuperating soil N within these developing secondary forests.","Eaton, W. D.

"156","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Climbing plants provide efficient pathways for ants to access patchy arboreal resources. However, plant stems vary greatly in physical characteristics that are likely to influence ant locomotion. We collected, measured and identified ants foraging on 671 stems of climbing plants at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We applied tuna baits to 70% of the observed stems to attract ants to a broad range of stem sizes. We used these data to examine relationships between relative stem roughness, growth form (herbaceous or woody), stem diameter and the body length of foraging ants representing 58 species. The size of the largest ants found on stems generally increased with stem size up to 3.2 mm diameter, whereas the size of the smallest ants present on stems did not vary with stem diameter. The largest ants in the forest (Paraponera clavata) used small stems (<2.7 mm diameter) only when attracted by baits. Average (+/-SE) ant body length was larger on woody (5.2 +/- 0.32 mm) vs. herbaceous (3.3 +/- 0.53 mm) stems, but did not differ between rough and smooth stems within these categories. Ant body-size distribution tended toward unimodality on smooth stems. We conclude that small stem diameter acts as a habitat filter based on ant body size, but only for the largest ants in the forest. The filter effect is reduced when ants are attracted to an artificially high quality resource.","Yanoviak, Stephen P.

"157","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Effective coordination of behaviors such as foraging and avoiding predators requires an assessment of cues provided by other organisms. Integrating cues from multiple sensory modalities may enhance the assessment. We studied cue integration by tadpoles of Oophaga pumilio, which live in small arboreal water pools. In this species, mothers periodically visit their tadpoles and feed them with unfertilized eggs. When mothers visit, tadpoles beg conspicuously by vibrating until fed. However, animals other than mother frogs including potential predators may visit water pools. Thus, when a visitor appears, tadpoles must use visitor cues to decide whether to beg or to remain inactive to avoid predation. To elucidate the cues that prompt these behaviors, we videotaped behavior of O. pumilio tadpoles in response to isolated and multimodal cues. Tadpoles swam more when exposed to visual or visual and chemical cues of adult O. pumilio but only exhibited begging when exposed to visual, chemical, and tactile cues together. Visual, chemical, and tactile cues from either male or female adult O. pumilio stimulated swimming and begging, but the same cues from similarly sized heterospecific frogs did not. Lastly, tadpoles exposed to a potential predator did not beg and swam less than tadpoles with no stimulus. Together, these findings suggest that O. pumilio tadpoles use multimodal cues to modulate swimming behavior accordingly in the presence of egg provisioners, predators, and other visitors and that tadpole begging is induced by multimodal cues of conspecific frogs such that tactile and perhaps chemical cues supplement visual cues.","Stynoski, Jennifer L.

Field staff can either be imported from urban areas or recruited from local residents. We evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of involving rural residents as local technicians over a 25- year period at active field research site in Costa Rica. We defined ""local technicians"" as local residents with no university education who acquired significant experience in field data collection, data management and/or laboratory work. We analyzed the experiences of incorporating these technicians into field research in developing countries from the points of view of scientist and of the local technicians themselves. Primary data were written responses from to a standardized survey of 19 senior scientists and Ph.D. students, and results from standardized personal interviews with 22 local technicians. Researchers highlighted the advantages of highly-skilled technicians with minimal staff turnover, as well as the technicians' knowledge of local ecological conditions. Local technicians considered the primary advantages of their jobs to be opportunities for continuing education training in science as well as cultural enrichment through interactions with people of different cultures. The main challenges identified by researchers were the lack of long-term funding for projects and extended training required for local technicians. Local technicians can be of great benefit to research projects by providing high-quality data collection at reasonable costs with low staff turnover. Over the last 25 years the research model at the field station we studied has evolved to the point that most long-term projects now depend heavily on local technicians. This model of involving local technicians in long-term research has multiple benefits for the researchers, the technicians and the local community, and could be adapted to a variety of settings in rural areas of developing countries.

Modeling of the geothermal fluids indicates that the fluid is supersaturated with aragonite and calcite, which matches the travertine precipitation close to the present discharge areas. Moreover, the barite and fluorite are also are near equilibrium levels, indicating possible control of Ba and F solubility by these mineral phases, which also precipitate in some discharge areas. Likewise, the fluid is supersaturated with respect to quartz, indicating the possibility of siliceous precipitation near the discharge areas of the present geothermal fluids.
Taking into account the Na-K, Na-K-Ca, and SiO(2)-temperature geothermometers, the temperature of the reservoir may be estimated to be about 135 degrees C.
The chemistry of the geothermal fluids has changed from a recent high-enthalpy system, which precipitated siliceous deposits, to the present low-enthalpy system, which precipitates carbonated deposits (travertine).
Multivariate analysis of the groundwater shows high correlations between K, Ca, As, Br, Ag, and Ba, suggesting that As is introduced to the environment via geothermal fluids. Moreover, As concentrations in hot groundwater are associated with high concentrations of Li and Si, as has been observed in other geothermal fields. Metal concentrations in the hydrothermal deposits show high values of Ag, As, Ba, Pb, Sb, and Zn, mainly in the siliceous deposits of the town of Caldes de Malavella, where the geothermal system deposited materials with high As concentrations (123-441 ppm).
The similarities between the geochemical characteristics of the hydrothermal deposits and the groundwater suggest that the metals in these deposits and fluids have the same origin. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Navarro, Andres

Under this hypothesis, differences in survival rate based on color pattern should be detectable. In many species of anoles, females show variation in dorsal patterns. These patterns consist of drab colors and are thought to have evolved as a predator-avoidance mechanism. We tested the FDP hypothesis for Norops humilis at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Three female patterns are found in this population. The dotted pattern occurs in males as well as females, whereas vertebral stripe and reticulated morphs are only found in females. To test FDP, we compared morph frequencies from population data collected at several sampling periods between 1981 and 2007, expecting to see fluctuations in frequencies over time. In addition, we predicted that the most common morph would experience higher mortality. Therefore, we analyzed survival rates from a capture-recapture study. We found that the dotted morph was more common in juveniles as well as in adults and adult morph frequencies remained stable over time. Survival rates supported this, showing no significant difference among morphs. The evidence supported rejection of the FDP hypothesis in this population of lizards. Possible scenarios to explain the stability of dorsal patterns and suggestions for future research are presented.","Paemelaere, Evi A. D.

"161","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Understanding the spatial variability of tropical forest structure and its impact on the radar estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) is important to assess the scale and accuracy of mapping AGB with future low frequency radar missions. We used forest inventory plots in old growth, secondary succession, and forest plantations at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica to examine the spatial variability of AGB and its impact on the L-band and P-band polarimetric radar estimation of AGB at multiple spatial scales. Field estimation of AGB was determined from tree size measurements and an allometric equation developed for tropical wet forests. The field data showed very high spatial variability of forest structure with no spatial dependence at a scale above 11 m in old-growth forest. Plot sizes of greater than 0.25 ha reduced the coefficients of variation in AGB to below 20% and yielded a stationary and normal distribution of AGB over the landscape. Radar backscatter measurements at all polarization channels were strongly positively correlated with AGB at three scales of 0.25 ha, 0.5 ha, and 1.0 ha. Among these measurements, PHV and LHV showed strong sensitivity to AGB<300 Mg ha(-1) and AGB<150 Mg ha(-1) respectively at the 1.0 ha scale. The sensitivity varied across forest types because of differences in the effects of forest canopy and gap structure on radar attenuation and scattering. Spatial variability of structure and speckle noise in radar measurements contributed equally to degrading the sensitivity of the radar measurements to AGB at spatial scales less than 1.0 ha. By using algorithms based on polarized radar backscatter, we estimated AGB with RMSE = 22.6 Mg ha(-1) for AGB<300 Mg ha(-1) at P-band and RMSE = 23.8 Mg ha(-1) for AGB<150 Mg ha(-1) at L-band and with the accuracy optimized at 1-ha scale within 95% confidence interval. By adding the forest height, estimated from the C-band Interferometry data as an independent variable to the algorithm, the AGB estimation improved beyond the backscatter sensitivity by 20% at P-band and 40% at L-band. The results suggested the estimation of AGB can be improved substantially from the fusion of lidar or InSAR derived forest height with the polarimetric backscatter. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Canopy exchange contributed most of the aboveground inputs to the forest soil of Na+, about half for K+, 10% for P and Mg2+ and negligible for N, C and other elements. Tree species composition did not account for the differences found in net throughfall between forest sites, and vegetation structure (plant area index) had only a small effect on net throughfall.

Thirty to 45 individuals were chosen per species to provide a relatively even height distribution from 1 m up to the maximum encountered height. Among small juveniles, the crown widths of the two species with the smallest leaves and horizontally spreading branches were greater than those of the four large-leaved species. On reaching and exceeding the canopy, all but one species showed pronounced increases in crown width with increasing height. These patterns are linked to leaf size and first branching height in small juveniles and low densities of emergent trees at La Selva and other tropical forests, where crown expansion in all directions enhances light interception under the equatorial sun in trees that are not crowded by neighbours of similar height.","King, David A.

Irradiance is considered the most important resource for seedling growth in the understory of wet tropical forests, but multiple soil nutrients and species have yet to be examined simultaneously with irradiance under field conditions. To identify potentially limiting resources, we modeled tree seedling growth as a function of irradiance and soil nutrients across five sites, spanning a soil fertility gradient in old-growth, wet tropical forests at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We measured an array of soil nutrients including total nitrogen (total N), inorganic N (nitrate [NO(3)(-)] and ammonium [NH(4)(+)]), phosphate (PO(4)(-)), and sum of base cations (SBC; potassium, magnesium, and calcium). Shade in the forest understory did not preclude seedling growth correlations with soil nutrients. Irradiance was a significant predictor of growth in 52% of the species, inorganic N in 54% (NO(3)(-) in 32%; NH(4)(+) in 34%), total N in 47%, SBC in 39%, and PO(4)(-) in 29%. Overall, growth was correlated with both irradiance and soil nutrients in 45% of species and with soil nutrients only in an additional 48%; rarely was irradiance alone correlated with growth. Contrary to expectations, the magnitudes of growth effects, assessed as the maximum growth response to significant resources for each species, were similar for irradiance and most soil nutrients. Among species whose growth correlated with soil nutrients, the rank importance of nutrient effects was SBC, followed by N (total N, NO(3)(-), and/or NH(4)(+)) and PO(4)(-). Species' growth responsiveness (i.e., magnitudes of effect) to irradiance and soil nutrients was negatively correlated with species' shade tolerance (survival under 1% full sun). In this broad survey of species and resources, the nearly ubiquitous effects of soil nutrients on seedling growth challenge the idea that soil nutrients are less important than irradiance in the light-limited understory of wet tropical forests.","Holste, Ellen K.

Such events may represent the first step for ecological diversification. They also play an important role in adaptive divergence and speciation.
2. A species that is able to do well across a range of environments has a higher plasticity than one whose success is restricted to a single or few environments. The breadth of environments in which a species can succeed is ultimately determined by the full pattern of its vital rates in each environment.
3. Examples of organisms colonizing novel environments are insect herbivores expanding their diets to novel host plants. One expectation for insect herbivores is that species with specialized diets may display less plasticity when faced with novel hosts than generalist species.
4. We examine this hypothesis for two generalist and two specialist neotropical beetles (genus Cephaloleia: Chrysomelidae) currently expanding their diets from native to novel plants of the order Zingiberales. Using an experimental approach, we estimated changes in vital rates, life-history traits and lifetime fitness for each beetle species when feeding on native or novel host plants.
5. We did not find evidence supporting more plasticity for generalists than for specialists. Instead, we found similar patterns of survival and fecundity for all herbivores. Larvae survived worse on novel hosts; adults survived at least as well or better, but reproduced less on the novel host than on natives.
6. Some of the novel host plants represent challenging environments where population growth was negative. However, in four novel plant-herbivore interactions, instantaneous population growth rates were positive.
7. Positive instantaneous population growth rates during initial colonization of novel host plants suggest that both generalist and specialist Cephaloleia beetles may be pre-adapted to feed on some novel hosts. This plasticity in host use is a key factor for successful colonization of novel hosts. Future success or failure in the colonization of these novel hosts will depend on the demographic rates described in this research, natural selection and the evolutionary responses of life-history traits in novel environments.","Garcia-Robledo, Carlos

Nomadic colonies raid roughly in straight line during the day and relocate their nests along this path in the evening. At BCI, nomadic colonies raid roughly in the same compass bearing of the previous day, presumably using their pheromone-marked raiding trails as cues to pick directions. Deviations from this direction occur when a nomadic colony fails to move, possibly due to environmental conditions. The generality of these results has been questioned. We studied nomadic colonies of E. burchellii at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica to evaluate the generality of the results obtained from BCI. We measured the angle between consecutive raids, manipulated the distribution of previous day's raid pheromones around nests to evaluate the effect of raid pheromone on foraging direction, and evaluated the effect of rainfall on the probability of moving and on deviation from the previous day's raid. Colonies did not follow the same compass bearing of the previous day and formed new raids on areas with previous day's raid pheromones or without them. Rainfall can explain when nomadic colonies move, but did not explain deviation from the previous day's raid direction.

Our objective was to investigate the relationship between rainfall and plant or soil nutrient characteristics to better understand the potential long-term effects that alterations in MAP could have on the nutrient dynamics of wet forest plant communities. Indicators of soil N availability (net mineralization and nitrification) decreased with MAP but were not related to foliar N. Soil and foliar P, by contrast, were not correlated with MAP but were positively correlated with each other. Thus, across our gradient foliar P was a better predictor of soil nutrient availability than foliar N. There were wide differences in foliar nutrient concentrations and N:P ratios among species within sites. At each site, legumes had higher mean percent N than nonlegumes, resulting in higher N:P ratios for legumes. Taken together, these data suggest that, at least in these forests, a climate-driven decrease in MAP could cause an increase in net N mineralization and nitrification for the wetter sites. However, this may not affect productivity at the community level because of low P availability, complex feedbacks between soil and foliar nutrients, and interactions with other biological and environmental factors such as elevation.","Alvarez-Clare, Silvia

However, in species-rich tropical forests it is largely unknown, how species differ in their response of mortality to resource availability and individual condition. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability, tree size and past growth on mortality of 284 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of vegetation density. Across the community, 78% of the species showed increasing mortality with increasing light. Considering species individually, just 29 species showed a significant response to light, all with increasing mortality at high light. Past growth had a significant impact on all but three species, with higher growth leading to lower mortality. For the majority of species, mortality decreased sharply with diameter in saplings, then levelled off or increased slightly towards the maximum diameter of the species. Diameter had the biggest impact on mortality, followed by past growth and finally light availability. Our results challenge many previous reports of higher mortality in shade, and we suggest that it is crucial to control for size effects when assessing the impact of environmental conditions on mortality.","Rueger, Nadja

"169","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In this study we use the 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product to develop multivariate linear regression models that estimate canopy heights over study sites at Howland Forest, Maine, Harvard Forest, Massachusetts and La Selva Forest, Costa Rica using (1) directional escape probabilities that are spectrally independent and (2) the directional spectral reflectances used to derive the directional escape probabilities. These measures of canopy architecture are compared with canopy height information retrieved from the airborne laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). Both the escape probability and the directional reflectance approaches achieve good results, with correlation coefficients in the range 0.54-0.82, although escape probability results are usually slightly better. This suggests that MODIS 500 m BRDF data can be used to extrapolate canopy heights observed by widely-spaced satellite LIDAR swaths to larger areas, thus providing wide-area coverage of canopy height.

Lidar and synthetic-aperture Radar are promising remote-sensing-based techniques for obtaining comprehensive measurements of forest structure at regional to global scales. In this study we investigate how Lidar-derived forest heights and Radar-derived aboveground biomass can be used to constrain the dynamics of the ED2 terrestrial biosphere model. Four-year simulations initialized with Lidar and Radar structure variables were compared against simulations initialized from forest-inventory data and output from a long-term potential-vegtation simulation. Both height and biomass initializations from Lidar and Radar measurements significantly improved the representation of forest structure within the model, eliminating the bias of too many large trees that arose in the potential-vegtation-initialized simulation. The Lidar and Radar initializations decreased the proportion of larger trees estimated by the potential vegetation by; similar to 20-30%, matching the forest inventory. This resulted in improved predictions of ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes and structural dynamics compared to predictions from the potential-vegtation simulation. The Radar initialization produced biomass values that were 75% closer to the forest inventory, with Lidar initializations producing canopy height values closest to the forest inventory. Net primary production values for the Radar and Lidar initializations were around 6-8% closer to the forest inventory. Correcting the Lidar and Radar initializations for forest composition resulted in improved biomass and basal-area dynamics as well as leaf-area index. Correcting the Lidar and Radar initializations for forest composition and fine-scale structure by combining the remote-sensing measurements with ground-based inventory data further improved predictions, suggesting that further improvements of structural and carbon-flux metrics will also depend on obtaining reliable estimates of forest composition and accurate representation of the fine-scale vertical and horizontal structure of plant canopies.","Antonarakis, Alexander S.

"171","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Wood influences channel morphology by increasing channel roughness, altering flow hydraulics, and decreasing sediment transport in most fluvial systems where it is present. In many locations, the collection of wood into jams leads to even greater interruption of sediment transport by means of sediment impoundment and the creation of low-velocity backwater flow zones. We examined tracer clast movement near a wood jam in a neotropical gravel-bed stream in order to evaluate the effect of wood mobility and piece transience on the ability of the jam to impede sediment transport. We found that the jam had minimal influence on the passage of any individual clast, with tracer clast mobilization and travel distance being best predicted by flow magnitude and grain size rather than location relative to the jam. The rate of clast passage through the jam did not correlate with either the piece retention rate of the jam or with the density of the jam. The jam did, however, temporarily trap a sediment wedge during a period when fluvially imported wood pieces blocked flow under a key wood piece, diverting flow to a secondary flow path. These results suggest that there is an upper bound on the flows in which wood is able to disrupt sediment transport, and unlike for bedrock roughness elements, this bound is frequently crossed at our study site.

Stoichiometric traits of individual species may result in some taxa playing disproportionately important roles in the recycling of nutrients relative to their biomass, acting as keystone nutrient recyclers. We examined factors controlling the relative contribution of 12 Neotropical fish species to nutrient recycling in four streams spanning a range of phosphorus (P) levels. In high-P conditions (135 mu g/L soluble reactive phosphorus, SRP), most species fed on P-enriched diets and P excretion rates were high across species. In low-P conditions (3 mu g/L SRP), aquatic food resources were depleted in P, and species with higher body P content showed low rates of P recycling. However, fishes that were subsidized by terrestrial inputs were decoupled from aquatic P availability and therefore excreted P at disproportionately high rates. One of these species, Astyanax aeneus (Characidae), represented 12% of the total population and 18% of the total biomass of the fish assemblage in our focal low-P study stream but had P excretion rates >10-fold higher than other abundant fishes. As a result, we estimated that P excretion by A. aeneus accounted for 90% of the P recycled by this fish assemblage and also supplied similar to 90% of the stream P demand in this P-limited ecosystem. Nitrogen excretion rates showed little variation among species, and the contribution of a given species to ecosystem N recycling was largely dependent upon the total biomass of that species. Because of the high variability in P excretion rates among fish species, ecosystem-level P recycling could be particularly sensitive to changes in fish community structure in P-limited systems.","Small, Gaston E.

The relationship between forest structure and H. leucosticta territory size was studied in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, during the non-breeding season in 2009. Forest structure was measured by assessing canopy openness and leaf area index (LAI) using hemispherical photography, while territory size was estimated with the playback technique using local conspecific vocalizations. Mean territory area was 3.8 +/- 2.8 ha (mean +/- SD, n = 10). Territory radius length was similar in old-growth forest and abandoned agro-forest plantations. We found that H. leucosticta territory size decreased as median LAI increased. We propose that LAI is related to territory size through the amount of leaf fall and subsequent leaf litter accumulation over the understorey plants, which constitutes an important reservoir of arthropod prey and nest materials for H. leucosticta. The long-term supply of food resources is likely to affect territory size in this species, as well as other insectivorous birds with similar foraging behaviour. These results are congruent with the structural cues hypothesis.","Esteban Vargas, Luis

"174","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Analyses relating long-term records of tree growth to interannual climatic variation at La Selva, Costa Rica have revealed marked forest sensitivities to both temperature and dry-season intensity (Clark et al. 2010). The tropical-forest biome is certain to become warmer, and many areas may become drier. Testing the generality of the La Selva findings with similar analyses of field data from diverse forests across the biome will be a valuable next step. Based on our experiences during the La Selva studies, we propose that such assessments will need to address three issues. One is the number of repeat forest measurements. Short series of re-censuses can be an unreliable basis for assessing climatic sensitivities. For some key climatic factors (e.g., temperature), records consisting of fewer than 10-12 re-censuses can span limited climatic ranges, producing erratic and largely nonsignificant correlations. Multiyear census intervals exacerbate these data limitations. Second, different types of forest-growth data call for different analysis approaches. Cohort and tree-ring records need to be adjusted for ontogenetic growth changes, while stand-level data require taking into account potentially confounding influences from forest compositional changes, as from succession. Third, a reliable meteorological record is critical. Poor-quality or internally inconsistent climatic records can fatally corrupt assessments of forest sensitivities. To be usable in such analyses, the meteorological record requires data quality control, gap filling, and adjustments to maintain the record's internal consistency in the face of commonly occurring methods changes (instruments, siting). We illustrate these issues using analyses of the long-term La Selva records.","Clark, Deborah A.

Airborne and field data were used from 28 tropical wet forest stands at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, with average biomass of 229 Mg-ha(-1). RMS scatters of remote sensing biomass estimates about field measurements were 58.3 Mg-ha(-1), 21%, and 76.1 Mg-ha(-1), 26%, for lidar and InSAR, respectively. Using mean forest height, the RMS scatter was 97 Mg-ha(-1), approximate to 34% for both lidar and InSAR. The confidence that Fourier transforms are a significant improvement over height was >99% for lidar and approximate to 90% for InSAR. Lidar Fourier transforms determined the useful range of vertical wavelengths to be 14 m to 100 m. Citation: Treuhaft, R. N., F. G. Goncalves, J. B. Drake, B. D. Chapman, J. R. dos Santos, L. V.

"177","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Wood in tropical streams has the potential to be more mobile than wood in otherwise similar temperate streams because of the warm and humid conditions that promote decay and the more frequent and flashier floods of the tropics. To test this hypothesis, we monitored all large wood pieces for 2.3 years in 10 50-m-long reaches of old-growth headwater streams in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Annual wood retention rates for pieces ranged from 0.55 to 0.91 among the sites, and retention rates by volume ranged from 0.67 to 0.99. Assuming steady state wood load, which is reasonable for La Selva, these rates are equivalent to mean residence times of 2.2-10.6 years for pieces, and 3.0-83.2 years for a volume of wood. Calculating mean residence time from the weighted average of retention rates gives an average residence time of 4.9 years for a piece of wood and 6.9 years for a volume of wood. These values are less than those reported for old-growth temperate forests, supporting our hypothesis. Mobility of individual pieces was best predicted by piece length relative to stream width (l(r), higher l(r) led to lower mobility), channel gradient (s, higher s led to higher mobility), and piece integration into the channel (unattached pieces were 2.6 times more mobile than attached, ramp, or bridge pieces). Temporal variation in retention rates was well explained by variation in peak flow. All four of these factors have also been observed to influence mobility in the temperate zone. The higher mobility of wood in our study site relative to the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest may be explained by the flashy and frequent floods, the high decay rate, or the branching morphology of the native trees; but differentiating the role of these factors, particularly flow and decay, will be complicated by their covariation across climates.

The CO2-rich Na-HCO3 thermal waters (up to 60 degrees C at the spring) have elevated arsenic concentrations ([As-T] from 50 to 80 mu g/L). The non-thermal waters are of Ca-Na-HCO3-Cl type and have [As-T] between <1 and 200 mu g/L, defining a hot-spot distribution. The present-day contribution of As from CO2-rich thermal waters to non-thermal aquifers is very limited, as shown by the concentration of geothermal tracers such as Li and B. Redox-controlling processes appear to govern the mobility of As in the non-thermal waters. Arsenate is clearly predominant in most oxidizing groundwaters (>85% of As(V) over total As), whereas reducing, high-As groundwater reaches up to 100% in arsenite. The reductive dissolution of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides and the coupled release and reduction of adsorbed As explain the elevated dissolved arsenite (up to 190 mu g/L) and Fe (up to 14 mg/L) content in the more reducing non-thermal groundwater. Conversely, the high levels of nitrate (up to 136 mg/L) ensure an oxidizing environment in most non-thermal groundwaters ([AS(T)] between <1 and 60 mu g/L). Under these conditions, Fe(III) oxyhydroxides are stable and As release to groundwater is not related to their dissolution. Instead, dissolved arsenate concentrations up to 60 mu g/L are explained by a competition for sorption sites with other species, mainly bicarbonate and silicic acid, while arsenate desorption due to pH increase is not considered a major process.

The allometric relationships between frond leaf area and frond length (from tip to base), and between frond leaf area and number of leaflets, were determined by natural logarithmic regressions to estimate the total area of each frond. Palm total leaf area was then estimated by adding the area of the composing fronds. We fit 14 separate regression models that related one or more of the morphological variables (number of fronds, diameter at breast height, stem height) to the total leaf area. Our results show that palm total leaf area is directly proportional to the number of fronds and palm size as reflected in stem height and diameter. Eight out of the 14 models had r (2) values of > 0.90 and incorporated a diverse combination of predictor variables. Simple linear regression models were more congruent with the observed values of total leaf area, whereas natural logarithmic models overestimated the value of total leaf area for large palms. Both approaches show a high degree of association among morphological characters in E. oleracea supporting the hypothesis that palms behave like unitary organisms, and are morphologically constrained by the lack of secondary meristems. To afford attaining canopy heights, woody palms need to show a high degree of phenotypic integration, shaping their growth and allometric relationships to match spatial and temporal changes in resources.","Avalos, Gerardo

The monodominant stands, established in abandoned pasture in 1988 at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, contained five species in a complete randomized block design. Native species were: Hieronyma alchorneoides, Pentaclethra macroloba, Virola koschnyi, and Vochysia guatemalensis. The exotic species was Pinus patula. By 16 years, the lack of differences among species in some attributes suggested strong abiotic control in this environment, where conditions are very favorable for growth. These attributes included aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), averaging 11.7 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) across species, and soil organic C (0-100 cm, 167 Mg C/ha). Other traits differed significantly, however, indicating some degree of biological control. In Vochysia plots, both aboveground biomass of 99 Mg C/ha, and belowground biomass of 20 Mg C/ha were 1.8 times that of Virola (P = 0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Differences among species in overstory biomass were not compensated by understory vegetation. Belowground NPP of 4.6 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) in Hieronyma was 2.4 times that of Pinus (P < 0.01). Partitioning of NPP to belowground components in Hieronyma was more than double that of Pinus (P = 0.03). The canopy turnover rate in Hieronyma was 42% faster than that of Virola (P < 0.01). Carbon sequestration, highest in Vochysia (7.4 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1), P = 0.02), averaged 5.2 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1), close to the annual per capita fossil fuel use in the United States of 5.3 Mg C. Our results indicated that differences in species effects on forest C balances were related primarily to differences in growth rates, partitioning of C among biomass components, tissue turnover rates, and tissue chemistry. Inclusion of those biological attributes may be critical for robust modeling of C cycling across the moist tropical forest biome.","Russell, Ann E.

This situation is especially true at low latitudes, as few attempts have been made to quantify patterns of space usage by tropical snake species. Here, we describe macro- and microhabitat use by the abundant pit viper Bothrops asper in the lowlands of Costa Rica. Specifically, we used radiotelemetry to monitor nine female and four male adult snakes at La Selva Biological Station between 2004 and 2006. We determined macrohabitat usage and availability on the basis of the movements of individual snakes and analyzed selection using compositional analysis. Microhabitat was quantified by a series of structural characteristics, and groups of locations were compared using multivariate ANOVA and discriminant function analysis. In our study, B. asper demonstrated a positive selection for swamp habitat and avoidance of human-disturbed areas by both male and female snakes. Microhabitat usage did not differ between males and females, but did differ for all individuals between daytime observations, when snakes were typically inactive, and nocturnal observations, when snakes moved to more exposed areas and foraged using ambush tactics. Microhabitat characteristics were significantly nonrandom at both times, suggesting that B. aver actively select particular sites for both diurnal retreat and nocturnal foraging sites. These data emphasize that the contrasting ways in which animals may utilize resources at separate times or for different activities should be considered in studies of overall habitat selection.","Wasko, Dennis K.

Because these factors broadly covary with latitude, separating their possible effects on species diversity is difficult. The Eocene was a much more equable world, however, with low temperature seasonality extending into lower-insolation higher, cooler latitudes, allowing us to test these factors by comparing insect species diversity in (1) modern, temperate, low-insolation, highly seasonal Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, U.S.A., 42 degrees 29'N; (2) modern, tropical, high-insolation, low-seasonality La Selva, Costa Rica, 10 degrees 26'N, and; (3) Eocene, temperate, low-insolation, yet low-seasonality McAbee, British Columbia, Canada, above 50 degrees N paleolatitude. We found insect diversity at McAbee to be more similar to La Selva than to Harvard Forest, with high species richness of most groups and decreased diversity of ichneumon wasps, indicating that seasonality is key to the latitudinal diversity gradient. Further, midlatitude Eocene woody dicot diversities at McAbee, Republic (Washington, U.S.A.), and Laguna del Hunco (Argentina) are also high, similar to modern tropical samples, higher than at the modern midlatitude Harvard Forest. Modern correlations between latitude, species diversity, and seasonal climates were established some time after the Eocene.","Archibald, S. Bruce

This is the first study to examine the effects of site (canopy, forest floor) and tree species (Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, Hyeronima alchorneoides) on decay rates of a common substrate and in situ leaf litter in a tropical forest in Costa Rica. Decay rates were slower for both substrates within the canopy than on the forest floor. The slower rate of mass loss of the common substrate in the canopy was due to differences in microclimate between sites. Canopy litter decay rates were negatively correlated with litter lignin:P ratios, while forest floor decay rates were negatively correlated with lignin concentrations, indicating that the control of litter decay rates in the canopy is P availability while that of the forest floor is carbon quality. The slower cycling rates within the canopy are consistent with lower foliar nutrient concentrations of epiphytes compared with forest floor-rooted plants. Litter decay rates, but not common substrate decay rates, varied among tree species. The lack of variation in common substrate decay among tree species eliminated microclimatic variation as a possible cause for differences in litter decay and points to variation in litter quality, nutrient availability and decomposer community of tree species as the causal factors. The host tree contribution to canopy nutrient cycling via litter quality and inputs may influence the quality and quantity of canopy soil resources.","Cardelus, Catherine L.","Cardelus, CL",NA,"300",NA,NA,NA,"10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00590.x",NA,"308","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAY",NA,"J",NA,"2010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"Litter Decomposition Within the Canopy and Forest Floor of Three Tree

Shade-house experiments showed that seeds with high amounts of endosperm removed by ants resulted in low germination success and low seedling biomass production. Although M. holtonii seeds are rich in L-dopa, this compound is not an effective chemical defence against mammals that possess foregut fermentation.

Most plantations in humid tropical regions are established in pure plots, including few species of high commercial value, generally exotics. The present study compares growth and economic viability of 15-16 year-old trees of native species in pure and mixed plantations on degraded pasturelands at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species with the best growth were Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, and Hieronyma alchorneoides. The mixed plantations performed better than pure plantations for all growth variables considered, including height, diameter at breast height, volume, and aboveground biomass. Mixed plantations outperformed pure plantations economically, with Net Present Value (NPV) of $1,124 to $8,155/ha and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 7.7-15.6% depending on the species mixture. The most profitable pure plantations were those of Vochysia guatemalensis, with NPV and IRR of $6,035/ha and 14.3%, respectively; Hieronyma alchorneoides ($2,654 and 10.8%); and Virola koschnyi ($1,906/ha and 9.22%). These are the estimated benefits that would be accrued at harvest. These projections are realistic since the decision to harvest is generally mandated not just by profit maximization but by economic necessity, thus many small- to medium-scale farmers in Costa Rica harvest plantations prior to the completion of the rotation length. Mixed plantation may be the preferred system for reforestation with native species designed for timber production or carbon sequestration because this system is more economically viable and productive than pure plantations.","Piotto, Daniel

"188","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In this paper we present the results of an experiment to measure forest structure and biomass dynamics over the tropical forests of La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica using a medium resolution lidar. Our main objective was to observe changes in forest canopy height, related height metrics, and biomass, and from these map sources and sinks of carbon across the landscape. The Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) measured canopy structure over La Selva in 1998 and again in 2005. Changes in waveform metrics were related to field-derived changes in estimated aboveground biomass from a series of old growth and secondary forest plots. Pairwise comparisons of nearly coincident lidar footprints between years showed canopy top height changes that coincided with expected changes based on land cover types. Old growth forests had a net loss in height of -0.33 m, while secondary forests had net gain of 2.08 m. Multiple linear regression was used to relate lidar metrics with biomass changes for combined old growth and secondary forest plots, giving an r(2) of 0.65 and an RSE of 10.5 Mg/ha, but both parametric and bootstrapped confidence intervals were wide, suggesting weaker model performance. The plot level relationships were then used to map biomass changes across La Selva using LVIS at a 1 ha scale. The spatial patterns of biomass changes matched expected patterns given the distribution of land cover types at La Selva, with secondary forests showing a gain of 25 Mg/ha and old growth forests showing little change (2 Mg/ha). Prediction intervals were calculated to assess uncertainty for each 1 ha cell to ascertain whether the data and methods used could confidently estimate the sign (source or sink) of the biomass changes. The resulting map showed most of the old growth areas as neutral (no net biomass change), with widely scattered and isolated sources and sinks. Secondary forests in contrast were mostly sinks or neutral, but were never sources. By quantifying both the magnitude of biomass changes and the sensitivity of lidar to detect them, this work will help inform the formulation of future space missions focused on biomass dynamics, such as NASA's Deformation Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice mission.","Dubayah, R.

A fully automated analytical methodology based on on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-LC-MS/MS) was developed for this purpose. The high selectivity and sensitivity achieved (limits of detection between 0.005 and 0.8 ng/L) permitted to demonstrate the ubiquity of these antibiotics in both ground water bodies. Results showed a wide range of concentrations, from 0.01 ng/L up to 3460.57 ng/L Since sulfonamides are related to livestock veterinary practices, they can be used as a specific indicator of manure contamination. However, the presence of sulfonamides appeared not to be directly related to the concentration of nitrates, as it is reflected on the low correlation coefficients found. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examined the mineral nutrition of three dominant vascular epiphyte groups: ferns, orchids, and bromeliads, and their host trees from samples collected along a 2600 m elevational gradient in the tropical wet forests of Costa Rica. We predicted that the mineral nutrition of ferns, orchids, and bromeliads would differ because of their putative differences in nutrient acquisition mechanisms and nutrient sources-atmospherically dependent, foliar feeding bromeliads would have lower nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations and more depleted delta(15)N values than those in canopy soil-rooted ferns because canopy soil is higher in available N, and more enriched in delta(15)N than the atmospheric sources of precipitation and throughfall. We also predicted that epiphyte foliar chemistry would mirror that of host trees because of the likely contribution of host trees to the nutrient cycle of epiphytes via foliar leaching and litter contributions to canopy soil. In the same vein, we predicted that epiphyte and host tree foliar chemistry would vary with elevation reflecting ecosystem-level nutrients-soil N availability increases and P availability decreases with increasing elevation. Our results confirmed that canopy soil-rooted epiphytes had higher N concentrations than atmospheric epiphytes; however, our predictions were not confirmed with respect to P which did not vary among groups indicating fixed P availability within sites. In addition, foliar delta(15)N values did not match our prediction in that canopy soil-rooted as well as atmospheric epiphytes had variable signatures. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) on foliar measurements determined that ferns, orchids, and bromeliads are statistically distinct in mineral nutrition. We also found that P concentrations of ferns and orchids, but not bromeliads, were significantly correlated with those of host trees indicating a possible link in their mineral nutrition's via canopy soil. Interestingly, we did not find any patterns of epiphyte foliar chemistry with elevation. These data indicate that the mineral nutrition of the studied epiphyte groups are distinct and highly variable within sites and the diverse uptake mechanisms of these epiphyte groups enhance resource partitioning which may be a mechanism for species richness maintenance in tropical forest canopies.","Cardelus, Catherine L.

We compared bird community changes of two lowland forest reserves, La Selva Biological Station (LSBS), Costa Rica and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, both approximately the same size (1500 ha) and at similar latitude (9-10 N) in Central America. Both reserves are losing bird species despite LSBS's connection to an existing large park (incomplete isolation) and BCI's favorable location within a largely forested landscape. We examined characteristics of guilds and species lost from the sites to determine whether patterns were similar, and thus predictable. Some of the same guilds declined at both reserves, particularly insectivores and ground/understory nesters. At LSBS mixed-species flock participants, forest species, and burrow-nesters also declined or became extirpated disproportionately. At BCI edge species became extirpated. Body mass was a poor predictor of species and guild loss at both sites, except for carnivores at La Selva. Thus, fragmentation appears to influence some guilds more than others, but which species decline or disappear in tropical forest fragments is also influenced by site-specific factors, mostly yet to be determined. We need to understand such idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation better, rather than rely on one-size-fits-all management plans to conserve bird communities in tropical forest fragments.

This mechanism was hypothesized as a possible explanation for biomass increases reported from tropical forests in the last 30+ years. We used unique long-term records of annually measured stands (eighteen 0.5 ha plots, 10 years) and focal tree species (six species, 24 years) to assess the effects of rainfall, temperature, and atmospheric [CO2] on annual wood production in a neotropical rain forest. Our study area was a meso-scale section (600 ha) of old-growth Tropical Wet Forest in NE Costa Rica. Using the repeated remeasurements we directly assessed the relative effects of interannual climatic variation and increasing atmospheric [CO2] on wood production. A remarkably simple two-factor model explained 91% of the interannual variance in stand-level tree growth; the statistically independent factors were total dry season rainfall (positive effect, r2=0.85) and night-time temperature (negative effect, r2=0.42). Stand-level tree mortality increased significantly with night-time temperature. After accounting for dry season rainfall and night-time temperature, there was no effect of annual [CO2] on tree growth in either the stand or focal species data. Tree growth in this Tropical Wet Forest was surprisingly sensitive to the current range of dry season conditions and to variations in mean annual night-time temperature of 1-2 degrees. Our results suggest that wood production in the lowland rainforests of NE Costa Rica (and by extension in other tropical regions) may be severely reduced in future climates that are only slightly drier and/or warmer.","Clark, David B.

(Lauraceae) and their cryptic ant symbiont, Myrmelachista flavocotea, is common in lowland wet forests of Costa Rica, yet it is unclear whether the association is typically mutualistic or parasitic. Ants impose costs by tending trophobionts inside the plant body and further compromise the structural integrity of their host by hollowing its stems. Benefits to the host, including anti-herbivore defense and nutrient provisioning, must outweigh these costs for the association to be mutualistic, but benefits in this system are largely unknown. We adopted a stable isotope approach to investigate trophic relationships among Ocotea hosts, coccoid trophobionts, and worker and larval ants in the understory of mature forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. In addition, a natural stable isotope marker (tuna) was made available to M. flavocotea colonies to determine whether ants are fortuitous scavengers and/or provision their host. In this system, we found unusual patterns of isotopic fractionation. For coccoids, nitrogen isotopes are only slightly enriched, and carbon isotopes were depleted relative to the host signature. Moreover, nitrogen signatures of the timid Myrmelachista ants are high, suggesting a substantial degree of carnivory and/or scavenging in this species. In the provisioning study, ant colonies provided with baits demonstrated a significant shift in carbon isotopic composition relative to untreated colonies indicating uptake and assimilation of the bait. These results suggest that these timid ants are patrolling the plant for food and concentrating nutrients in Ocotea's hollowed stems. Further studies are required to confirm if M. flavocotea provides a net benefit to its host by providing nutrients, reducing herbivory, or by removing detrimental debris from the plants surface.","McNett, K.

It is characterised by its stomatal morphology, possession of six triangular cuticle flaps covering stomatal opening, duplicated cheilo- and gymnostomatal walls, large dorsal tooth and sclerotised ventral stegostomatal ridges, female with vulval flap, male spicule and gubernaculum morphology, i.e., relatively straight spicule with oval-shaped manubrium, rounded flap-like rostrum and separated and strongly ventrally curved spicule with bifurcate tip, gubernaculum L-shaped in lateral view and anchor-shaped in ventral view, and filiform tail of both sexes. Sequences from the three A. megaloptae n. sp. geographical/host isolates were not significantly different and molecular phylogenetic analysis and biological and morphological comparisons place the new species close to A. halicti from Halictus ligatus and A. puri from Augochlora pura from North America, although the new species is distinguished from A. halicti and A. puri based upon its stomatal morphology of males and females, male spicule and gubernaculum morphology and female vulval structure.","Kanzaki, Natsumi

"196","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Animals use honest signals to assess the quality of competitors during aggressive interactions. Current theory predicts that honest signals should be costly to produce and thus reveal some aspects of the phenotypic or genetic quality of the sender. In songbirds, research indicates that biomechanical constraints make the production of some acoustic features costly. Furthermore, recent studies have found that vocal features are related to genetic diversity. We linked these two lines of research by evaluating if constrained acoustic features reveal male genetic diversity during aggressive interactions in ocellated antbirds (Phaenostictus mcleannani). We recorded the aggressive vocalizations of radiotagged males at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, and found significant variation in the highest frequency produced among individuals. Moreover, we detected a negative relationship between the frequency of the highest pitched note and vocalization duration, suggesting that high pitched notes might constrain the duration of vocalizations through biomechanical and/or energetic limitations. When we experimentally exposed wild radiotagged males to simulated acoustic challenges, the birds increased the pitch of their vocalization. We also found that individuals with higher genetic diversity (as measured by zygosity across 9 microsatellite loci) produced notes of higher pitch during aggressive interactions. Overall, our results suggest that the ability to produce high pitched notes is an honest indicator of male genetic diversity in male-male aggressive interactions.","Araya-Ajoy, Yi-men

"198","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In tropical rain forests, rates of forest turnover and tree species' life-history differences are shaped by the life expectancy of trees and the time taken by seedlings to reach the canopy. These measures are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest. However, the relationship between size, age, and life expectancy is poorly understood. In this paper, we show how to obtain, in a dynamic environment, age-related population parameters from data on size and light transitions and survival of individuals over single time steps. We accomplish this goal by combining two types of analysis (integral projection modeling and age-from-stage analysis for variable environments) in a new way. The method uses an index of crown illumination (CI) to capture the key tree life-history axis of movement through the light environment. We use this method to analyze data on nine tropical tree species, chosen to sample two main gradients, juvenile recruitment niche (gap/nongap) and adult crown position niche (subcanopy, canopy-emergent). We validate the method using independent estimates of age and size from growth rings and C-14 from some of the same species at the same site and use our results to examine correlations among age-related population parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new results for life histories of tropical trees.","Metcalf, C. Jessica E.

Forest age could affect both fruit sugar concentrations via differences in light availability or disperser abundance, and fruit removal rates via differences in bird and plant community composition. We examined how these two factors are affected by forest age in a Costa Rican rain forest. We compared seven young-secondary forest species, seven old-growth forest species, and Miconia nervosa growing in both forests. We measured sugar concentrations ill fruits and manipulated the location of paired fruiting branches, measuring subsequent fruit removal. Sugar concentration means were on average 2.1 percentage points higher in young-secondary forest species than in old-growth forest species. but did not differ among Miconia nervosa fruits from the two forests. Fruit removal rates were higher in young-secondary forest for 86% of young-secondary forest species, 71% of old-growth forest species, and on average for both young-secondary and old-growth forest Miconia nervosa individuals. Higher sugar concentrations in young-secondary forest plants could reflect stronger competition for dispersers, while experimental fruit removal results suggests the opposite patterns of competition: fruits are more likely to be removed by dispersers in young-secondary forest independent of fruit nutrient concentration.","Lumpkin, Heather A.

In bedrock groundwater, high delta C-13 (-4.89%), low C-14 (7.98 pM), high R/R-A for He (6.88), and low Cl-36/Cl (17 x 10(-15)) suggest that elevated tracer concentrations are derived from magmatic outgassing and/or weathering of volcanic rock beneath nearby Volcan Barva. In local groundwater, the magmatic signature is absent, and data suggest atmospheric sources for He and Cl and a biogenic soil gas CO2 source for dissolved inorganic carbon. Dating of C-14 suggests that the age of bedrock groundwater is 2400-4000 years (most likely at the lower end of the range). Local groundwater has C-14 > 100 pM, indicating the presence of ""bomb carbon'' and thus ages less than similar to 55 years. Overall, data are consistent with a conceptual hydrologic model originally proposed on the basis of water budget and major ion data: (1) large variation in solute concentrations can be explained by mixing of the two distinct groundwaters, (2) bedrock groundwater is much older than local groundwater, (3) elevated solute concentrations in bedrock groundwater are derived from volcanic fluids and/or rock, and (4) local groundwater has not interacted with volcanic rock. Tracers with different capabilities converge on the same hydrologic interpretation. Also, transport of magmatic CO2 into the lowland rain forest via IGF seems to be significant relative to other large ecosystem-level carbon fluxes.","Genereux, David P.

However, published studies indicate that fine roots decay relatively slowly in tropical forests. To resolve this discrepancy, we used the intact-core technique to quantify first-year decay rates of fine roots in four single-species plantations of native tree species. We tested three hypotheses: first, that fine roots from different tree species would decay at different rates; second, that species having rapid fine root growth rates would also have rapid rates of fine root decay; and third, that differences in fine root decay among species could be explained by fine root chemistry variables previously identified as influencing decay rates. Fine roots in Virola koschnyi plantations decayed very slowly (k = 0.29 +/- A 0.15 year(-1)); those of Vochysia guatemalensis decayed seven times faster (k = 2.00 +/- A 0.13 year(-1)). Decay rates of the remaining two species, Hieronyma alchorneoides and Pentaclethra macroloba, were 1.36 and 1.28 year(-1), respectively. We found a positive, marginally significant correlation between fine root decay rates and the relative growth rates of live fine roots (R = 0.93, n = 4, P = 0.072). There was a highly significant negative correlation between fine root decay and fine root lignin:N (R = 0.99, P = 0.01), which supports the use of lignin:N as a decay-controlling factor within terrestrial ecosystem models. The decay rates that we observed in this single study location encompassed the entire range of fine root decay rates previously observed in moist tropical forests, and thus suggest great potential for individual tree species to alter belowground organic matter and nutrient dynamics within a biotically rich rainforest environment.","Raich, James W.

Epiphytic species also exhibited increasing species diversity with increasing trunk height. Epiphytic species exhibited predictable patterns of distribution along the trunk and were easily grouped into high-trunk, low trunk, or bimodal categories. In terms of percent cover and number of species, simple-leaved ferns dominated the epiphytic growth form, 13 of 21 species, whereas ferns with compound or dissected leaves dominated the hemi-epiphytic and terrestrial floras with 20 of 20 species.

For streams with drainage areas of 0.1-8-5 km(2) and gradients of 0.2-8%, wood load ranged from 3 to 34-7 m(3) wood/100 m channel and 41-612 m(3) wood/ha channel. These values are within the range reported for temperate streams. The variables wood diameter/flow depth, stream power, the presence of backflooding, and channel width/depth are consistently selected as significant predictors by statistical models for wood load. These variables explain half to two-thirds of the variability in wood load. These results, along with the spatial distribution of wood with respect to the thalweg, suggest that transport processes exert a greater influence on wood loads than recruitment processes.

We found that caterpillar species with a strong immune response had the lowest incidence of parasitism, and when statistically compared to other defensive traits, the immune response was the best predictor of parasitism. Parasitoids either avoid attacking caterpillar species with a capacity for high levels of melanization or are killed once they have parasitized. In either case, the immune response is clearly one of the most effective defenses that caterpillars have against parasitism, and elucidating consistent predictors of variation in encapsulation could improve understanding of parasitism patterns in time and space and could enhance biological control efforts.","Smilanich, Angela M.

We selected 8 common riparian tree species from La Selva and 7 from Coweeta that spanned the range of chemistries of leaf litter naturally entering streams at each site. We predicted that concentrations of secondary compounds would be higher in the tropical species than in the temperate species and that high concentrations of condensed tannins would decrease breakdown rates in both sites. Contrary to our predictions, mean concentration of condensed tannins was significantly greater (2.6x, p<0.001) for species at Coweeta than for species at La Selva. Concentration of condensed tannins was negatively correlated with breakdown rate among Coweeta species (r=-0.80), not among La Selva species, and negatively correlated when the 2 sites were combined (r=-0.53). Concentrations of structural compounds were strongly correlated with breakdown rate at both sites (Coweeta species, lignin r=-0.94, cellulose r=-0.77; La Selva species, cellulose r=-0.78, C r=-0.73).

This specificity most likely results from processes at the seedling stage, but light rather than nutrient levels is generally considered the dominant limitation for seedling growth in the tropical forest understory. If nutrients are limiting and allocation to belowground resources differs, seedling growth responses to shade should also differ. Here we tested the effects of soil type and light environment on the seedling growth of two canopy tree species in the genus Inga with different soil-type and light-environment affinities as adults. Inga alba is a shade-tolerant soil generalist and I. oestediana is a light-demanding soil specialist. We used four native soils and three light levels (1 and 5% of full sun in shade houses and the forest understory). All growth variables were greatest in 5% full sun, with highest growth rates for the light-demanding soil-type specialist. Soil type significantly affected growth parameters, even at the lower light levels. The specialist grew best on the soils with the most soil phosphorus where adult trees typically occur. Leaf tissue nitrogen:phosphorus ratios suggest increased phosphorus limitation in the low phosphorus soils and with increased light level. Light and soil interacted to significantly affect seedling biomass allocation, growth, and net assimilation rates, indicating that the seedling shade responses were affected by soil type. Seedlings growing on high nutrient soil allocated less to roots and more to photosynthetic tissue. Adult distributions of these two Inga species may be a result of the different growth rates of seedlings in response to the interactive effects of light and soil.","Palow, D. T.

However, leaf volatiles may also be used by insect herbivores as cues to locate their host plants. Leaf volatiles are suggested to be important host search cues for herbivores in structurally complex and diverse habitats, such as tropical rain forests. A group of insect herbivores, the rolled-leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Hispinae), have maintained a highly specialized interaction with Neotropical gingers (Zingiberales) for ca. 60 million years. In this study, we explored chemical attraction to host plants under controlled laboratory conditions, using four sympatric rolled-leaf beetle species, Cephaloleia dorsalis Baly, Cephaloleia erichsonii Baly, Cephaloleia fenestrata Weise, and Cephaloleia placida Baly. For each beetle species, we investigated (i) whether it was repelled or attracted by leaf scents produced by four host and four non-host plant species, including Neotropical gingers in the families Marantaceae, Costaceae, and Zingiberaceae; and (ii) its ability to use scents to detect its host plant. We found that rolled-leaf beetles can detect and are attracted by leaf volatiles from both host and non-host gingers. Additionally, when beetles were simultaneously exposed to leaf volatiles from host and non-host plants, three rolled-leaf beetle species were significantly more attracted by volatiles from their host plants than from non-hosts.

"212","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Plants frequently display fruit characteristics that support multiple seed-dispersal syndromes. These ambiguous characteristics may reflect the fact that seed dispersal is usually a complex process involving multiple dispersers. This is the case for the Neotropical ginger Renealmia alpinia (Zingiberaceae). It was originally suggested that the aromatic fruits of R. alpinia located at the base of the plant are adapted for terrestrial mammal seed dispersal. However, the dark-purple coloration of the fruits and bright orange aril surrounding the seeds suggest that birds may play a role in R. alpinia seed dispersal. At La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we used camera traps to record vertebrate visits to infructescences of R. alpinia. Most visitors were toucans and aracaris (Ramphastidae). However fruits were also removed by terrestrial mammals (coatis and armadillos). In addition to vertebrate fruit removal, some of the fruits dehisce and the seeds that fall on the ground are dispersed by ants. Fruitfall traps showed that 77 percent of fruits are removed by vertebrates. However, 15 percent of fruits fall to the base of parent plants to be potentially dispersed by ants. Experiments using a laboratory ant colony showed that ants are effective seed dispersers of R. alpinia. Ant seed manipulation increased germination success and reduced time to germination. In conclusion, primary seed dispersal in the Neotropical ginger R. alpinia is mostly performed by birds, additionally ants are effective dispersers at short distances. Seed dispersal in R. alpinia is a complex process involving a diverse array of dispersal agents.","Garcia-Robledo, Carlos

Among snakes, this information is often lacking even for species that are abundant, ecologically important, and/or relevant to human health. We used radiotelemetry to examine the spatial ecology and behavior of the fer-de-lance (Bothrops asper), a highly venomous pit viper that is ubiquitous throughout much of Central America. Sixteen adult snakes were tracked over 2 yr in lowland rainforest of Costa Rica to determine home range, movement patterns, and foraging behavior. Consistent with previous descriptions, B. asper was found to be a highly nocturnal ambush predator, exhibiting virtually no activity during the day. Overall home range was determined using both minimum convex polygon (mean size = 5.95 ha) and 95 and 50 percent kernel density (mean size = 3.71 and 0.370 ha, respectively); home range size did not differ between males and females by any estimation method. Movement pattern was largely aseasonal and unrelated to any observed environmental conditions other than the daily low temperature. Most movements consisted of short (< 10 m) movements between daytime shelter and nocturnal ambush sites within a given area, interspersed with longer distance (> 50 m) movements to new foraging areas. Compositional analysis of habitat usage indicated an avoidance of developed areas and selection of swamp habitat. Most snakes had several activity cores (50% kernel density), the majority which were in or near swamps. These patterns suggest that space and habitat usage of fer-de-lance may be related to foraging strategy.","Wasko, Dennis K.

There are, however, few studies of tropical nematode diversity on which to base conclusions of global patterns of diversity. This study reports an attempt to estimate nematode diversity in the lowland tropical rainforest of La Selva Biological Research Station in Costa Rica. We suggest one reason that previous estimates of tropical nematode diversity were low is because habitats above the mineral soil are seldom sampled. As much as 62% of the overall genetic diversity, measured by an 18S ribosomal barcode, existed in litter and understorey habitats and not in soil. A maximum-likelihood tree of barcodes from 360 individual nematodes indicated most major terrestrial nematode lineages were represented in the samples. Estimated 'species' richness ranged from 464 to 502 within the four 40 x 40 m plots. Directed sampling of insects and their associated nematodes produced a second set of barcodes that were not recovered by habitat sampling, yet may constitute a major class of tropical nematode diversity. While the generation of novel nematode barcodes proved relatively easy, their identity remains obscure due to deficiencies in existing taxonomic databases. Specimens of Criconematina, a monophyletic group of soil-dwelling plant-parasitic nematodes were examined in detail to assess the steps necessary for associating barcodes with nominal species. Our results highlight the difficulties associated with studying poorly understood organisms in an understudied ecosystem using a destructive (i.e. barcode) sampling method.","Powers, T. O.

Here we report the first application of light detection and ranging remote sensing to measurements of canopy disturbance and regeneration in an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape. Pervasive local height changes figure prominently in the dynamics of this forest. Although most canopy gaps recruited to higher positions during 8.5 years, size frequency distributions were similar at two points in time and well-predicted by power-laws. At larger spatial scales (hundreds of ha), height increases and decreases occurred with similar frequency and changes to canopy height that were analysed using a height transition matrix suggest that the distribution of canopy height at the beginning of the study was close to the projected steady-state equilibrium under the recent disturbance regime. Taken together, these findings show how widespread local height changes can produce short-term stability in a tropical rain forest landscape.","Kellner, James R.

"216","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Litter-induced pulses of nutrient availability could play an important role in the productivity and nutrient cycling of forested ecosystems, especially tropical forests. Tropical forests experience such pulses as a result of wet-dry seasonality and during major climatic events, such as strong El Ninos. We hypothesized that (1) an increase in the quantity and quality of litter inputs would stimulate leaf litter production, woody growth, and leaf litter nutrient cycling, and (2) the timing and magnitude of this response would be influenced by soil fertility and forest age. To test these hypotheses in a Costa Rican wet tropical forest, we established a large-scale litter manipulation experiment in two secondary forest sites and four old-growth forest sites of differing soil fertility. In replicated plots at each site, leaves and twigs (< 2 cm diameter) were removed from a 400-m(2) area and added to an adjacent 100-m(2) area. This transfer was the equivalent of adding 5-25 kg/ha of organic P to the forest floor. We analyzed leaf litter mass, [N] and [P], and N and P inputs for addition, removal, and control plots over a two-year period. We also evaluated basal area increment of trees in removal and addition plots. There was no response of forest productivity or nutrient cycling to litter removal; however, litter addition significantly increased leaf litter production and N and P inputs 4-5 months following litter application. Litter production increased as much as 92%, and P and N inputs as much as 85% and 156%, respectively. In contrast, litter manipulation had no significant effect on woody growth. The increase in leaf litter production and N and P inputs were significantly positively related to the total P that was applied in litter form. Neither litter treatment nor forest type influenced the temporal pattern of any of the variables measured. Thus, environmental factors such as rainfall drive temporal variability in litter and nutrient inputs, while nutrient release from decomposing litter influences the magnitude. Seasonal or annual variation in leaf litter mass, such as occurs in strong El Nino events, could positively affect leaf litter nutrient cycling and forest productivity, indicating an ability of tropical trees to rapidly respond to increased nutrient availability.","Wood, Tana E.

Because buttresses grow LIP the trunk through time. it has become common practice to increase the height: of measurement, to ensure that measurements remain above the buttress. However, tapering of the trunk means that increasing measurement height will bias estimates of diameter downward by up to 10% per m of height. This bias Could affect inference concerning species differences and climate effects on tree demography and on biomass accumulation. Here we introduce a hierarchical state space method that allows formal integration of data on diameter taken at different heights and can include individual variation, temporal effects or other covariates. We illustrate our approach using species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. and La Selva, Costa Rica. Results include trends that are consistent with some of those previously reported for climate responses and changes over time, but differ in relative magnitude. By including the full data-set and accounting for bias and variation among individuals and over time, our approach allows for quantification of climate responses and the uncertainty associated with measurements and the underlying growth process.","Metcalf, C.

"219","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","1. Throughout much of the tropics, habitat loss is increasing and intensifying on the unprotected land surrounding conservation areas. The influence of these land-use changes on biodiversity is poorly understood. This study used data on dung beetles, a taxonomic group widely acknowledged to be an effective ecological indicator of anthropogenic disturbance, to evaluate temporal changes in diversity inside a natural protected area.
2. Using data from quantitative sampling events over the last 35 years along with an exhaustive review of the information available in museums and the literature, we present evidence suggesting that the dung beetles community structure has shifted dramatically over time at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.
3. To date, 50 dung beetle species have been reported from La Selva. Of these, 10 (20%) were consistently collected within the study timeframe while 21 species (42%) were uncommon. Our results indicate a tendency toward decreasing species richness and changes in species composition over time.
4. Analysis of the community structure revealed a decrease in diversity (H'), an increase in dominance (D) and a decrease in evenness (J) over the 35-year period; all of which can be linked to an increase in the dominance of one species (Onthophagus acuminatus). These changes were also reflected in the proportional abundance of major species guilds.
5. Synthesis and applications. Despite the relatively low human impact within La Selva, this study suggests that the dung beetle community has changed as result of habitat loss in the surrounding landscape and the progressive increasing isolation of the reserve over the last 35 years. Our findings, together with studies of other biota in the reserve, indicate a worrying decline in the conservation value of La Selva in recent decades. This shift in the diversity and composition of native forest biota needs to be taken into account in future studies that continue to rely on La Selva as providing an intact baseline for comparative research. More importantly, we suggest that the size of the reserve may need to be increased if its ecological integrity is to be restored. This study provides further evidence that isolated protected areas may often fail to safeguard biodiversity in the long term, and that to be viable, conservation strategies urgently need to adopt a wider landscape perspective.","Escobar, Federico

Here, we assess interpopulation female mate choice by conducting phonotaxis experiments on a population of the Amazonian frog Engystomops petersi in Puyo, Ecuador. Our results show very strong behavioral isolation relative to 1 of 2 foreign populations. Puyo females strongly discriminate against La Selva in favor of Puyo or Yasuni signals. In contrast, Puyo females do not discriminate against signals from Yasuni, which are similar in frequency. Behavioral isolation was stronger than expected because Puyo females were unable to recognize La Selva courtship signals as belonging to conspecific males. Overall, female mate choices are consistent with male courtship signal differentiation among populations but inconsistent with geographic or genetic distances. Simulations under a null model of undirected evolution (Brownian motion) suggest directional selection on courtship signals at La Selva. Based on our results, we hypothesize that sexual selection and/or reinforcement is driving speciation between E. petersi populations.","Guerra, Monica A.

Does competition, inferred from spatial pattern between neighbouring trees, affect adult tree spacing patterns in an tropical forest? At what size-class or stage is competition between neighbours most likely to affect adult tree spacing patterns?
Location: Kibale National Park, western Uganda.
Methods: Relationships between focal tree size and nearest neighbour distance, size, density, and species in a 4-ha permanent plot, using point pattern analyses.
Results: We found non-random patterns of distribution of nearest tree neighbours (stems > 10 cm DBH). Independent of identity, tree density was highest and neighbours were regularly spaced within 3-5m of an individual. Tree densities were lower and relatively constant at distances > 5m and neighbours were typically randomly spaced. In general, conspecific patterns conformed to the latter trends. Thus, individual area of influence was small (within a radius of 3-5 m). Rarer species were more clumped than common species. Weak competitive thinning occurred among more densely packed small trees (< 20 cm DBH), and rapidly disappeared with increasing tree size and distance from an individual. The clumping and density of individuals was not significantly affected by tree size.
Conclusions: Negative effects of competition among trees are weak, occur within the crown radius of most individuals, and are independent of adult tree size and identity. The density of neighbouring trees (aggregation) did not decline with increasing focal tree size at either the conspecific or the community level and tree diameter (tree size) was not a good estimator of the implied competitive influence of a tree. Mechanisms operating at the recruitment stage may be important determinants of adult tree community diversity and spacing patterns.","Lawes, Michael J.

We compared nesting success of real birds' nests in large and small forest fragments to a control site in Caribbean lowland wet forest of Costa Rica. Pooling across species, nesting success was significantly greater in unfragmented forest than in either small, isolated fragments or the La Selva Biological Reserve, which is at the tip of a forest 'peninsula' embedded in a largely deforested landscape. Nesting success in isolated fragments did not vary according to distance from edge, suggesting that predators in fragments act throughout these forest patches. The case for increased nest predation as a plausible mechanism to explain the documented decline of forest interior bird populations in this fragmented tropical landscape is enhanced by a simple demographic model that suggests nesting success is likely too low to maintain populations at La Selva and in the fragments. The fact that the large (> 1000 ha) La Selva forest reserve is experiencing nest predation rates similar to those in much smaller fragments is cause for concern. Our results make a strong case for additional studies to document the identities of nest predators in both fragmented and unfragmented forests in such tropical forest landscapes.","Young, Bruce E.

"224","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","We used the facultatively social sweat bee Megalopta genalis (Halictidae) to test whether body size is associated with social caste. Behavioral observations showed that non-reproductive foragers were significantly smaller than reproductive nest mate queens, and foragers were also smaller than presumed pre-dispersal reproductives. Moreover, among females from field-collected nests without behavioral observations, relative body size correlated with relative ovary size. Reproductive status is not a direct result of body size, as body size was not significantly associated with either ovary size or fecundity among both solitary and social reproductives. Reproductive status is apparently an outcome of social competition for reproductive dominance, and status is influenced by size relative to nest mates. Our study is the first to demonstrate an association of body size with caste expression in a facultatively social species with relatively weak seasonal constraints on independent nesting. Larvae of a parasitic fly (Fiebrigella sp., Chloropidae) consume pollen provisions stored in nest cells of M. genalis and M. ecuadoria. We tested whether fly parasitism of M. genalis reduces body size. Parasitized females are significantly smaller as adults than their unparasitized nestmates. This reduction is of a similar magnitude to the size differences between castes, and has the potential to shape host reproductive options by influencing competition with nest mates. We present data on the prevalence of parasitism from four collections of M. genalis and two collections of M. ecuadoria from Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and La Selva, Costa Rica.","Smith, Adam R.

"226","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Question: What is the influence of remnant trees on secondary forest structure and composition in tropical pastures many years after abandonment?
Location: Neotropical lowland wet forest, La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.
Methods: Tree and sapling density, basal area, and species richness were quantified at three distances from remnant trees, 0 - 10 m ( inner), 20 - 30 m ( intermediate), and ca. 50 m ( distal) zones. A total of 15 remnant trees were sampled in pastures similar to 23 years after abandonment.
Results: Tree density decreased along a gradient from inner ( 1117 +/- 377 individuals/ ha) to distal ( 592 +/- 282 individuals/ ha) zones, and the number of large- seeded individuals ( seeds > 1 cm diameter) was significantly greater in the inner zone. Basal area of tree individuals was greater in the inner ( 25.6 +/- 12 m(2)/ ha) and intermediate ( 28.3 +/- 15.6 m(2)/ ha) zones than the distal zone ( 14.7 +/- 7.2 m2/ ha), but there were no differences between inner and intermediate zones. Similar patterns are reported for species richness. Additionally, saplings ( 1 - 5 cm DBH) had higher density directly beneath and adjacent to remnants, suggesting that remnant trees can affect recruitment even many years after pasture abandonment and the formation of a surrounding secondary forest.
Conclusions: Results indicate that remnant trees facilitate forest recovery over a broad temporal range, and appear to ' nucleate' forest regeneration by expanding their sphere of influence outward over time.","Schlawin, Justin

The fully inventoried bat assemblage at La Selva Biological Station (LS, 100 m elevation) in Costa Rica was used as a reference site to evaluate seven estimators of species richness. The Jackknife 2 method agreed best with the known bat species richness and thus was used to extrapolate species richness for an Amazonian bat assemblage (Tiputini Biodiversity Station; TBS, 200 m elevation) and an Andean premontane bat assemblage (Podocarpus National Park; BOM, 1000 m elevation) in Ecuador. Our results suggest that more than 100 bat species occur sympatrically at TBS and about 50 bat species coexist at BOM. TBS harbours one of the most species-rich bat assemblages known, including a highly diverse phyllostomid assemblage. Furthermore, we related assemblage structure to large-scale geographical patterns in floral diversity obtained from botanical literature. Assemblage structure of these three phyllostomid assemblages was influenced by differences in floral diversity at the three sites. At the Andean site, where understorey shrubs and epiphytes exhibit the highest diversity, the phyllostomid assemblage is mainly composed of understorey frugivores and nectarivorous species. By contrast, canopy frugivores are most abundant at the Amazonian site, coinciding with the high abundance of canopy fruiting trees. Assemblage patterns of other taxonomic groups also may reflect the geographical distribution patterns of floral elements in the Andean and Amazonian regions.

Soil pathogens could be an important mechanism of such noncompetitive distance and density-dependent (NCDD) mortality, but susceptibility to local pathogens may be ameliorated by a life history strategy that favors survivorship. In a shade-house experiment (1% full sun), we tested seedling life span, growth, and mass allocation responses to microbial extract filtered from conspecific-cultured soil in 21 tree species that varied in abundance and shade tolerance in a wet tropical forest (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica). Forty-three percent of the species had significant reductions, and 10% of the species had significant increases in life span, growth, root length, or root surface area when inoculated with microbial extract; 10% of the species experienced opposing reductions and increases in these characteristics. Contrary to expectation, species' local abundance was not related to species-specific responses to microbial extracts from cultured soils. Across species, seedling shade tolerance (survival at 1% full sun) was negatively correlated with susceptibility to the microbial treatment for both survival and total mass accumulation, thereby exaggerating shade tolerance differences among species. Thus, soil pathogens may contribute to species coexistence through heightening niche differentiation rather than through negative density dependence in common species.","McCarthy-Neumann, Sarah

"229","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Sulfur is one of the macronutrient elements whose sources to terrestrial ecosystems should shift from dominance by rock-weathering to atmospheric deposition as soils and underlying substrate undergo progressive weathering and leaching. However, the nature and timing of this transition is not well known. We investigated sources of sulfur to tropical rain forests growing on basalt-derived soils in the Osa Peninsula region of Costa Rica. Sulfur sources were examined using stable isotope ratios (delta(34)S) and compared to chemical indices of soil development. The most weathered soils, and the forests they supported, are dominated by atmospheric sulfur, while a less weathered soil type contains both rock-derived and atmospheric sulfur. Patterns of increasing delta(34)S with increasing soil sulfur concentration across the landscape suggest atmospheric sulfur is accumulating, and little rock-derived sulfur has been retained. Soil sulfur, minus adsorbed sulfate, is correlated with carbon and nitrogen, implying that sulfur accumulation occurs as plants and microbes incorporate sulfur into organic matter. Only the lower depth increments of the more weathered soils contained significant adsorbed sulfate. The evidence suggests a pattern of soil development in which sulfur-bearing minerals in rock, such as sulfides, weather early relative to other minerals, and the released sulfate is leached away. Sulfur added via atmospheric deposition is retained as organic matter accumulates in the soil profile. Adsorbed sulfate accumulates later, driven by changes in soil chemistry and mineralogy. These aspects of sulfur behavior during pedogenesis in this environment may hasten the transition to dominance by atmospheric sources.","Bern, Carleton R.

These birds congregate at swarms of army ants to capture fleeing prey, and previous observations suggest that males may be philopatric, feed with close relatives, and defend communal feeding ranges. We assessed whether kin selection could be an important factor maintaining group formation in a population of ocellated antbirds inhabiting continuous forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, using radiotelemetry and 15 novel microsatellite markers. We predicted that the roosting areas of closely related adult males should overlap and that adult males feeding simultaneously at the same swarm should be highly related. We banded and genotyped 65 individuals (>= 88% of the population) and radiotagged 30 of them. The results generally did not conform to our predictions. Little overlap occurred among the roosting areas of same-sex individuals, and nearest roosting neighbours (either same or opposite sex) were generally unrelated. A small proportion of male dyads suggested short-distance dispersal, but in general the distribution of genotypes within the study area approached randomness. We found little evidence of natal philopatry in either sex. Less than half of the feeding groups sampled included highly related males; most consisted of unrelated individuals. Hence, we found limited potential for kin selection to favour group living and suggest that other factors, particularly direct benefits (e.g. food intake), are probably more important than indirect effects (nepotism).","Chaves-Campos, Johel

The study included old growth forest on high fertility soils, old growth forest on low fertility soils, and secondary forest on intermediate fertility soils. Forest floor litter was removed from a 16 in 2 area and added to an adjacent 4 m(2) area in March 2003, resulting in a one to four-fold increase in the annual litter input to the forest floor. We created three addition, three removal and three control plots per forest type. We measured treatment effects on variation in soil moisture, temperature, pH, and Bray-1 P (plant available) over a 5-month period that captured the dry-wet season transition. Litter manipulation had no effect on any of the soil properties measured during the 5-month study period. Significant variability through time and a similar temporal pattern across the three forest stands suggest that climatic variability is driving short-term patterns in these soil properties rather than seasonal inputs of litter. In general, soils were warmer, drier and more basic with higher available P during dry season months. Even in wet tropical forests, small variability in climate can play an important role in soil dynamics over periods of weeks to months. Although litter manipulation did not influence soil properties over the 5-month study period, a longer lag may exist between the timing of litter inputs and the influence of that litter on soil properties, especially plant available P.","Wood, Tana E.

Plantations can help speed up secondary forest succession by improving soil conditions, attracting seed-dispersal agents, and providing shade necessary for understory growth. In this study, abundance and richness of understory regeneration was measured in three native tree plantations 15-16 years of age at La Selva Biological Station in the Costa Rican Caribbean lowlands. Each plantation contained tree species in pure plots, a mixture of the species, and natural regeneration plots (no trees planted). The greatest abundance of regeneration was found in the understory of pure plots of Jacaranda copaia (Aubl.) D.Don., Vochysia guatemalensis Donn.Sm., Dipteryx panamensis Benth, Vochysia ferruginea Mart., and in two mixed stands, while the lowest was found in the natural regeneration treatments with about half the values as in the plantation stands. There was a significant negative correlation between percent canopy openness and abundance of regeneration in the understory. Two distinctive clusters separated the regeneration treatments from the mixed and pure plantations at a very low Bray-Curtis similarity value. The natural regeneration treatments are separated from mixed and pure plantations in the two-dimensional ordination. The lack of difference between the understory make-up of pure and mixed plantations in abundance, species richness, and seed-dispersal syndromes of understory species suggests that planting mixed stands is not necessarily superior to planting pure stands for promoting understory diversity of woody species. While regeneration of woody species can be faster under pure- or mixed-species plantations than in open pastures, the abundance, richness and species composition depends on each plantation species, or species assemblages in case of the mixtures.

To explore links between these phenomena, we measured stem diameter increment and phenology often canopy tree species from a range of functional types in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica to test for seasonal and interannual patterns. We measured stem diameter increment using band dendrometers and visually assessed leaf and reproductive phenology monthly from 1997 to 2000. We categorized the species into groups based on patterns of leaf exchange and reproduction. Species were either deciduous with synchronous or asynchronous leaf drop, or evergreen with continuous or seasonal leaf flushing. Flowering occurred supra-annually, annually, or continuously. Of the ten species studied, four species, Cecropia insignis, Dipteryx panamensis, Lecythis ampla, and Simarouba amara, had consistent seasonal stem diameter increment patterns in both years. Dipteryx panamensis and L. ampla were deciduous with synchronized leaf drop. Cecropia insignis was evergreen and produced new leaves continuously. Simarouba amara, also evergreen, exchanged leaves over a brief period once a year. We tested whether stem diameter increment was correlated to phenology using logistic regression. Leaflessness significantly explained patterns in stem diameter increment but reproductive phenology did not. Deciduous trees were 2.6-9.3 times more likely to grow less than average the month following leaffall than in months when trees had full crowns.","O'Brien, Joseph J.

The record indicates that the highly diverse rain forest that presently surrounds the Cantarrana swamp regrew following forest clearing and maize agriculture that ended only a few centuries ago. The first maize pollen appears in sediments deposited similar to 1070 calendar-year BP. Older sediments below the 'maize zone' contain macroscopic charcoal, abundant microscopic charcoal, and possible pollen indicators of forest clearance, perhaps signaling local cultivation of root crops that left no pollen in the sediments. Interpretation of local archaeology indicates that La Selva reserve may have been most heavily populated during the El Bosque and La Selva regional archaeological phases from 2250-950 yr BP. However, the distribution of maize pollen in the sediments is clear evidence that the reserve was also occupied during the later La Cabana phase (950-400 yr BP), from which few artifacts have yet surfaced. Natural forest disturbance from treefalls and stream dynamics, and hydrological shifts associated with late-Holocene climate variability, form a backdrop to the human land-use history preserved in the Cantarrana sediment profile.","Kennedy, Lisa M.

A total of 311 reproductively mature trees, 99 large saplings, 207 small saplings, and 601 seedlings were genotyped using 141 AFLP loci. Parentage analysis revealed high dispersal distances, both for seed (over 2.3 km) and pollen (over 3.8 km), indicating a large genetic neighborhood within La Selva Biological Station. In a 20-ha area of second growth, the founding palm population was dominated by a small number of parental trees located in the adjacent old-growth forest; two old-growth trees contributed 48% of the second-growth genes. The genetic diversity of reproductively mature trees in this second-growth forest was significantly reduced compared to adjacent old-growth forest. Within 400 m of the border with old-growth forest, we observed a similar reduction of genetic diversity in saplings, and an even greater loss of genetic diversity in the second generation of seedlings. Nearly half of these seedlings were offspring of local parents. In contrast, in the distant portion of second-growth forest (400-800 m from the old-growth border), parentage analysis showed that 40% of seedlings originated from outside the study area and only 10% were offspring of local parents. These high levels of gene flow maintained genetic diversity in saplings and seedlings similar to levels observed in old-growth forest. Our findings highlight the importance of gene flow from diverse seed and pollen sources for sustaining levels of genetic diversity of tree populations in second-growth forests.","Sezen, Uzay U.

The inflorescences of A. uncinata exhibit a suite of cantharophilous characters including a precisely synchronized anthesis, protogyny, thermogenesis, olfactory attraction of visitors via modified staminodes, and narrow interfloral entrances. The weevil pollinators use the inflorescences for feeding, mating, and oviposition. The larvae are detritivorous and develop either in the detaching staminate flowers or, at a more favorable rate, in the rotting infructescences. The rate of infructescence abortion was high and caused by low levels of pollination. Manual pollination treatments yielded significantly higher seed counts than obtained under natural conditions, and furthermore demonstrated the inflorescences' ability to reproduce via geitonogamy. In the longer term, the reproductive benefits of maintaining low levels of pollination may shift away from the weevils and towards the plants via an increase in the size of the pollinator population.","Franz, N.

Stilt roots have been proposed to serve a number of functions including the facilitation of rapid vertical growth to the canopy and enhanced mechanical stability. To examine whether stilt roots provide these functions, we compared stilt root characteristics of the neotropical palm tree Socratea exorrhiza on sloped (> 20 degrees) and flat locations at two lowland neotropical sites. S. exorrhizu (n=80 trees) did not demonstrate differences in number of roots, vertical stilt root height, root cone circumference, root cone volume, or location of roots as related to slope. However, we found positive relationships between allocation to vertical growth and stilt root architecture including root cone circumference, number of roots, and root cone volume. Accordingly, stilt roots may allow S. exorrhiza to increase height and maintain mechanical stability without having to concurrently invest in increased stem diameter and underground root structure. This strategy likely increases the species ability to rapidly exploit light gaps as compared to non-stilt root palms and may also enhance survival as mature trees approach the theoretical limits of their mechanical stability.","Goldsmith, Gregory R.

Here we present a case of nonlinear interactions between temporal and spatial scales in a high spatial- and temporal-resolution study of fine-root biomass responses to edaphic and climatic variation in a lowland tropical rain forest (La Selva, Costa Rica). The spatiotemporal variation in fine roots in this forest was considerably greater than that for aboveground live biomass and litterfall. Standing stocks of both live and dead fine roots varied strongly during a seven-year period (up to 10-fold) and across two edaphic gradients with different soil nutrient and water variation (up to four-fold). Fine-root biomass decreased with soil fertility and volumetric soil water content, but responses across a landscape gradient (decreasing with total soil P and K and increasing with N:P ratio between two Oxisols with different weathering) differed from those across a topographic gradient in older Oxisols (increasing with total Fe and Al and decreasing with Ca, Mg, and C:N ratio down the slopes). The spatial contrasts across the landscape gradient (but not in the topographic gradient) changed substantially through time, and they, in fact, disappeared entirely by the middle of the study interval. Shortterm monitoring of belowground standing biomass could thus lead to important biases when quantifying root responses. The positive time X gradient interaction in fine-root biomass across soil types (but not downslope) also indicates nonlinear changes in spatial patterns across temporal scales, so studies on temporal responses also need to be spatially explicit at narrow scales. This interaction also appears to be more complex than previously recognized: semester-averaged fine-root biomass was negatively correlated with soil water content in the preceding semester, but the relationship was restricted to residual Oxisols. To increase the accuracy of global carbon cycle models in the future, a critical complement to observations of ecosystem processes at regional and global scales will be quantifying these processes through multiple years and across the substantial edaphic gradients that typically exist within landscapes.","Espeleta, J.

We examined epiphytic, hemiepiphytic, and terrestrial ferns, and asked whether there are differences in the mineral nutrition and water relations across different growth forms of a diverse assemblage of species. We measured specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen concentrations, and natural abundance of the stable isotopes delta N-15 and delta C-13 of 48 fern species from 36 genera across a wide range of habitats at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. We found that epiphytes were significantly different in all measured variables from hemiepiphytic and terrestrial species, and that terrestrial and soil-rooted hemiepiphytes were indistinguishable in all variables excluding SLW. A multivariate analysis revealed that aspects of N nutrition were the most reliable at separating epiphytic species from other life forms. Our study demonstrates that the natural abundance of both C and N as well as N relations and leaf morphology are useful when segregating different plant life forms, and that the N cycle of epiphytic and terrestrial habitats function independently from each other.","Watkins, James E., Jr.

Five large aggregations were found 30-100 m from larger rivers at the La Selva Biological Station. The relatively short nesting season, from May to August, indicates that E. metatarsalis is probably univoltine. Four nests were excavated to study nest architecture, and five brood cells from three different nests were analyzed for pollen composition. Additionally, we analyzed pollen loads from 33 females returning from pollen-collecting trips, and we observed male patrolling behavior. The canopy tree Apeiba membranacea Spruce ex Benth (Tiliaceae) was found to be the principal pollen source, representing an average proportion of 98.5% of each pollen load and 93.4% of the larval provisions. The brood cell with the lowest proportion of A. membranacea pollen contained 89.3% A. membranacea pollen, which was 98.5% by relative volume. Pollen of Byrsonima crispa A. Juss. (Malpighiaceae) was the second most frequently encountered pollen with average proportions of 1.3 and 4.9% in pollen loads and larval provisions, respectively. E. metatarsalis can thus be considered oligolectic. The E. metatarsalis nesting season coincides with the relatively short flowering season of B. crispa, perhaps because of the importance of B. crispa as a source of oils rather than nectar.","Thiele, Rainer

The change in surface SOC over 15 yr ranged from -0.03 to 0.66 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The species differed in the quantity and chemical composition of their detrital production. Soil organic C was significantly correlated with fine-root growth, but not with aboveground detrital inputs. Soil organic C increased with potential C mineralization on a grams of C basis, indicating that species influenced both the quality and quantity of SOC. Contrary to expectations, SOC declined with increasing fine-root lignin concentrations, indicating that lignin-derived C did not dominate refractory SOC pools. We hypothesize that differences among species in the capacity to increase SOC stocks involved fine-root traits that promoted soil microbial turnover and, thus, greater production of recalcitrant, microbial-derived C fractions.","Russell, A.

More than one-third of amphibian species are globally threatened, and over 120 species have likely suffered global extinction since 1980. Most alarmingly, many rapid declines and extinctions are occurring in pristine sites lacking obvious adverse effects of human activities. The causes of these ""enigmatic"" declines remain highly contested. Still, lack of long-term data on amphibian populations severely limits our understanding of the distribution of amphibian declines, and therefore the ultimate causes of these declines. Here, we identify a systematic community-wide decline in populations of terrestrial amphibians at La Selva Biological Station, a protected old-growth lowland rainforest in lower Central America. We use data collected over 35 years to show that population density of all species of terrestrial amphibians has declined by approximate to 75% since 1970, and we show identical trends for all species of common reptiles. The trends we identify are neither consistent with recent emergence of chytridiomycosis nor the climate-linked epidemic hypothesis, two leading putative causes of enigmatic amphibian declines. Instead, our data suggest that declines are due to climate-driven reductions in the quantity of standing leaf litter, a critical micro-habitat for amphibians and reptiles in this assemblage. Our results raise further concerns about the global persistence of amphibian populations by identifying widespread declines in species and habitats that are not currently recognized as susceptible to such risks.","Whitfield, Steven M.

"251","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Aim The biodiversity of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera) along a complete tropical elevational gradient was studied for the first time. The patterns are described, and the role of geometric constraints and environmental factors is explored.
Location The study was carried out along the Barva Transect (10 degrees N, 84 degrees W), a complete elevational gradient ranging from 40 to 2730 m a.s.l. in Braulio Carrillo National Park, Costa Rica, and adjacent areas.
Methods Moths were sampled manually in 2003 and 2004 at 12 rain forest sites using light 'towers', each with two 15 W ultraviolet fluorescent tubes. We used abundance-based rarefaction, statistical estimation of true richness (Chao 1), geographically interpolated observed richness and Fisher's alpha as measures of local diversity.
Results A total of 13,765 specimens representing 739 species were analysed. All four measures showed a hump-shaped pattern with maxima between 500 and 2100 m elevation. The two subfamilies showed richness and diversity maxima at either lower (Ennominae) or higher (Larentiinae) elevation than Geometridae as a whole. Among the four environmental factors tested, relative humidity yielded the highest correlation over the transect with the rarefaction-based richness estimates as well as with estimated true species richness of Geometridae as a whole and of Larentiinae, while rainfall explained the greatest variation of Ennominae richness. The elevational pattern of moth richness was discordant with both temperature and with tree species richness. A combination of all environmental factors in a stepwise multiple regression produced high values of r(2) in Geometridae. The potential effects of geometric constraints (mid-domain effect, MDE) were investigated by comparing them with observed, interpolated richness. Overall, models fitted very well for Geometridae as a whole and for Ennominae, but less well for Larentiinae. Small-ranged species showed stronger deviations from model predictions than large-ranged species, and differed strikingly between the two subfamilies, suggesting that environmental factors play a more pronounced role for small-ranged species. We hypothesize that small-ranged species (at least of the Ennominae) may tend to be host specialists, whereas large-ranged species tend to be polyphagous. Based on interpolated ranges, mean elevational range for these moths was larger with increasing elevation, in accordance with Rapoport's elevational rule, although sampling effects may have exaggerated this pattern. The underlying mechanism remains unknown because Rapoport's 'rescue' hypothesis could not explain the observed pattern.
Conclusions The results clearly show that moth diversity shows a hump-shaped pattern. However, remarkable variation exists with regard to taxon and range size. Both environmental and geometric factors are likely to contribute to the observed patterns.","Brehm, Gunnar

There were 1628, 1478 and 1954 trees in the plots, representing 168, 166 and 171 species respectively. We determined the species of each nearest-neighbor pair of trees, and asked whether the occurrence of species pairs conforms to a simple random mixing model. If trees are randomly mixed in terms of species, the expected frequency of any nearest neighbor species combination is a function of the relative abundance of the two species. Departures from random mixing could arise from species interactions, differential responses to habitat, or both. The number of possible ij species combinations increases approximately as the square of the number of species. For the 168 species in plot 1, for example, there are 14 196 possible combinations. We compared the expected frequency of each species combination in the three plots (42 736 combinations in all) with observed frequencies. Over 98% of the combinations had observed frequencies of zero and expected frequencies close to zero. A consequence of high diversity is low density of most individual species, and exceedingly low frequencies of the vast majority of species combinations. For each of the 805 combinations with observed frequencies > 0, we used simulation to generate a distribution of expected frequencies. We used a t-test to compare the observed frequency with the mean of the simulated distribution for each combination. Only 40 combinations (0.09% of the possible species combinations in the plots) departed from expected frequencies; 39 combinations were more common, and one less common than expected. The overwhelming majority of nearest neighbor species combinations occur at frequencies predictable from their individual abundances.","Lieberman, Milton

We selected two soils of similar parent material, but of different ages and soil moisture regimes to identify possible clues to the coexistence of these two minerals. We employed selective dissolution procedures, X-ray fluorescence analysis and X-ray diffraction on field moist and air dry bulk soil samples to investigate how mineralogy changes with depth. We further separated the size fraction < 2 mu m by means of sedimentation after organic matter and iron oxide removal to obtain more specific information on the phyllosilicate mineralogy of the clay size fraction.
We found both soils to be depleted of primary minerals and pedogenesis to have progressed to advanced weathering stages particularly in the subsoils. Gibbsite XRD signal intensities were linearly and significantly related to weathering indices, corroborating the residual nature of gibbsite as an endproduct of weathering processes. The Si-bearing quartz and kaolinite-group minerals were enriched in the topsoils, indicating (i) their independence from a primary mineral Si source and (ii) the existence of a mechanism capable of protecting them against the continuous tropical weathering pressure. As we found no indications for retrospective additions of soil material through mass movement or aeolian additions, we believe a vegetation dependent, biological pumping mechanism to be the most plausible explanation for the presence of silica bearing minerals in the La Selva topsoils.
The vertical distribution of 1.0 nm halloysite and its accumulation in the lower reaches of the wetter alluvial soil suggest that this metastable mineral forms as a result of Si enrichment where the residence time of the pore water is long enough to allow for Si concentrations to exceed the halloysite precipitation threshold. Taken together, our evidence indicates gibbsite in the La Selva soils to be the endproduct of intense tropical weathering, while the presence of hydrated halloysite seems to have mainly kinetic reasons and is most probably coupled to the contemporary soil moisture regime.

"256","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Questions: To what extent are the distributions of tropical rain forest tree ferns (Cyatheaceae) related to environmental variation, and is habitat specialization likely to play a role in their local coexistence?
Location: Lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.
Methods: Generalized linear (GLM) and generalized additive (GAM) logistic regression were used to model the incidence of four tree fern species in relation to environmental and neighbourhood variables in 1154 inventory plots regularly distributed across 6 km(2) of old-growth forest. Small and large size classes of the two most abundant species were modelled separately to see whether habitat associations change with ontogeny.
Results: GLM and GAM model results were similar. All species had significant distributional biases with respect to micro-habitat. Environmental variables describing soil variation were included in the models most often, followed by topographic and forest structural variables. The distributions of small individuals were more strongly related to environmental variation than those of larger individuals. Significant neighbourhood effects (spatial autocorrelation in intraspecific distributions and non-random overlaps in the distributions of certain species pairs) were also identified. Overlaps between congeners did not differ from random, but there was a highly significant overlap in the distributions of the two most common species.
Conclusions: Our results support the view that habitat specialization is an important determinant of where on the rain forest landscape tree ferns grow, especially for juvenile plants. However, other factors, such as dispersal limitation, may also contribute to their local coexistence.","Jones, M. M.

Moths were trapped with automatic 8W ultraviolet light traps at three sites in the understorey and canopy of a primary forest at the La Selva Biological Station (10.4 degrees N, 84.0 degrees W). A total of 846 arctiid moths (148 species) and 946 geometrid moths (140 species) were analysed. Species richness and diversity of arctiid moths was significantly lower in the understorey than in the canopy (Fisher's alpha: 24 vs. 49) whereas geometrid moths showed an inverse pattern (Fisher's alpha: 44 vs. 27). This resulted in an overall increase in the proportion of conspicuously coloured species towards the canopy. Moth ensembles were clearly separated in multidimensional scaling ordinations, and differed significantly in their faunal composition and dominance between the strata. The available host plant data suggest that the flight height of moths was determined by larval resource availability. Examples include understorey flyers such as the geometrid genus Eois feeding on Piper, and canopy flyers such as the arctiid moth genera Aclytia, Macrocneme and Poliopastea which feed on lianas.

In this study, five species were selected to examine crown-level spectral variation within and between species using HYperspectral Digital Collection Experiment (HYDICE) data collected over La Selva, Costa Rica. Spectral angle was used to evaluate the spectral variation in reflectance, first derivative and wavelet-transformed spectral domains. Results indicated that intra-crown spectral variation does not always follow a normal distribution and can vary from crown to crown, therefore presenting challenges to statistically define the spectral variation within species using conventional classification approaches that assume normal distributions. Although derivative analysis has been used extensively in hyperspectral remote sensing of vegetation, our results suggest that it might not be optimal for species identification in tropical forestry using airborne hyperspectral data. The wavelet-transformed spectra, however, were useful for the identification of tree species. The wavelet coefficients at coarse spectral scales and the wavelet energy feature are more capable of reducing variation within crowns/species and capturing spectral differences between species. The implications of this examination of intra- and inter-specific variability at crown-level were: (1) the wavelet transform is a robust tool for the identification of tree species using hyperspectral data because it can provide a systematic view of the spectra at multiple scales; and (2) it may be impractical to identify every species using only hyperspectral data, given that spectral similarity may exist between species and that within-crown/species variability may be influenced by many factors.

"263","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport/retention was determined at four sites in three rainforest streams draining La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. La Selva is located at the base of the last remaining intact rainforest transect from similar to 30 m above sea level to 3000 m along the entire Caribbean slope of Central America. Steam SRP levels can be naturally high there due to regional, geothermal groundwater discharged at ambient temperature. Monitoring since 1988 has revealed distinctive long-term differences in background SRP and total P (TP) for three streams in close proximity, and identified the impact of ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) events on SRP-enriched reaches. Mean interannual SRP concentrations (+/- standard deviation) were 89 +/- 53 mu g/l in the Salto (1988-1996), 21 +/- 39 mu g/l in the Pantano (1988-1998), and 26 +/- 35 mu g/l in the Sabalo (1988-1996). After January, 1997 the separate upland-lowland contributions to discharge and SRP load were determined monthly in the Salto. SRP in Upper Salto was low (19 +/- 8 mu g/l, 1997-2002) until enriched at the upland-lowland transition by regional groundwater. Mean SRP concentration in Lower Salto (108 +/- 104 mu g/l) was typically highest February-April, the driest months, and lowest July-September, the wettest. SRP concentration was positively correlated to the inverse of discharge in Lower Salto when ENSO data were omitted (1992 and 1998-1999), but not in the Upper Salto, Pantano, or Sabalo. TP was positively correlated to the inverse of discharge in all three streams when ENSO data were omitted. High SRP springs and seeps along the Lower Salto contributed 36% of discharge but 85% of SRP export 1997-2001. Annual SRP flux from the total Salto watershed (1997-2001) averaged 2.9 kg/ha year, but only 0.6 kg/ha year from the Upper Salto. A dye tracer injection showed that pore water environments were distinctly different between Upper and Lower Salto. Upper Salto had high surface water-pore water exchange, high dissolved oxygen, low SRP, and low conductivity similar to surface water, and Lower Salto had low surface water-pore water exchange, low dissolved oxygen, high SRP, and high conductivity reflecting geothermal groundwater influence. SRP export from the Salto was controlled by regional groundwater transfer, which in similar volcanic settings could be a significant P source. However, ENSO events modified the SRP concentration in the Salto suggesting that long-term monitoring is required to understand underlying SRP dynamics and P flux to downstream communities.","Triska, Frank J.

"264","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport/retention was determined in two rain forest streams (Salto, Pantano) draining La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. There, SRP levels can be naturally high due to groundwater enriched by geothermal activity within the surfically dormant volcanic landscape, and subsequently discharged at ambient temperature. Combined field and laboratory approaches simulated high but natural geothermal SRP input with the objective of estimating the magnitude of amended SRP retention within high and low SRP settings and determining the underlying mechanisms of SRP retention. First, we examined short-term SRP retention/transport using combined SRP-conservative tracer additions at high natural in situ concentrations. Second, we attempted to observe a DIN response during SRP amendment as an indicator of biological uptake. Third, we determined SRP release/retention using laboratory sediment assays under control and biologically inhibited conditions. Short-term in situ tracer-SRP additions indicated retention in both naturally high and low SRP reaches. Retention of added SRP mass in Upper Salto (low SRP) was 17% (7.5 mg-P m(-2) h(-1)), and 20% (10.9 mg-P m(-2) h(-1)) in Lower Salto (high SRP). No DIN response in either nitrate or ammonium was observed. Laboratory assays using fresh Lower Salto sediments indicated SRP release (15.4 +/- 5.9 mu g-P g dry wt.(-1) h(-1)), when incubated in filter sterilized Salto water at ambient P concentration, but retention when incubated in filter sterilized river water amended to 2.0 mg SRP l(-1) (233.2 +/- 5.8 mu g-P g dry wt.(-1) h(-1)). SRP uptake/release was similar in both control- and biocide-treated sediments indicating predominantly abiotic retention. High SRP retention even under biologically saturated conditions, absence of a DIN response to amendment, patterns of desorption following amendment, and similar patterns of retention and release under control and biologically inhibited conditions all indicated predominantly abiotic P flux.","Triska, Frank

Many tropical forests grow on deeply weathered soils and although it is generally accepted that soil carbon decomposition increases with higher temperatures, it is not known whether subsurface carbon pools are particularly responsive to increasing soil temperatures. Carbon dioxide (CO2) diffusing out of soils is an important flux in the global carbon. Although soil CO2 efflux has been the subject of many studies in recent years, it remains difficult to deduct controls of this flux because of the different sources that produce CO2 and because potential environmental controls like soil temperature and soil moisture often covary. Here, we report results of a 5-year study in which we measured soil CO2 production on two deeply weathered soil types at different depths in an old-growth tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. Three sites were developed on old river terraces (old alluvium) and the other three were developed on old lava flows (residual). Annual soil CO2 efflux varied between 2.8-3.6 mu mol CO2-C m(-2) s(-1) (old alluvium) and 3.4-3.9 mu mol CO2-C m(-2) s(-1) (residual). More than 75% of the CO2 was produced in the upper 0.5 m (including litter layer) and less than 7% originated from the soil below 1 m depth. This low contribution was explained by the lack of water stress in this tropical wet forest which has resulted in very low root biomass below 2 m depth. In the top 0.5 m CO2 production was positively correlated with both temperature and soil moisture; between 0.6 and 2 m depth CO2 production correlated negatively with soil moisture in one soil and positively with photosynthetically active radiation in the other soil type. Below 2 m soil CO2 production strongly increased with increasing temperature. In combination with reduced tree growth that has been shown for this ecosystem, this would be a strong positive feedback to ecosystem warming.","Schwendenmann, Luitgard

More than a half of the tree species studied (e.g. Calophyllum brasiliense, Jacaranda copaia, Terminalia amazonia, Hyeronima alchorneoides, Vochysiaferruginea, Balizia elegans) are distributed from Mexico-Guatemala to South America and a few have more limited distribution in Central America (e.g. Vochysia guatemalensis, Virola koschnyi, Dipteryx panamensis). The nine tree species are divided into three sets. The 3 members of each set were grown separately in pure plantations, and together in I mixed plantation, giving 12 monocultures and 4 mixtures. Plantation 1 (13 years old) is composed of V guatemalensis, C. brasiliense, and J. copaia. Plantation 2 (13 years old) is comprised of D. panamensis, T amazonia and V koschnyi. Plantation 3 (12 years old) is composed of H. alchorneoides, B. elegans, and V. ferruginea. Overall, all the species had good growth and productivity either in pure or mixed stands in comparison to other native and exotic species growing in similar ecological conditions. The exception was C. brasiliense in mixed stands, where it was suppressed by the fast-growing species V guatemalensis and J. copaia. At the stand level, the mixed stands performed well for volume, basal area, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration, in comparison to other pure or mixed plantations of tropical timber species. Pure plantations of V guatemalensis, V ferruginea, V koschnyi, J. copaia, and T amazonia also presented good productivity. At the tree level, V guatemalensis, J. copaia, T amazonia, H. alchorneoides, and D. panamensis performed better in mixtures than in pure stands for diameter, height, aboveground biomass, and carbon sequestration estimations. Values for the former three species were significantly higher in mixed than in pure stands. C. brasiliense was the only species with significantly better growth in pure stands than in mixed stands, for the three-species combination examined. The results show that mixed plantings had similar or higher productivities for several of the variables examined, but conclusions, on relative productivities depend on the species and growth features, interactions among species, and the variables quantified. In addition, there is a need to continue monitoring over longer time-frames, and for further studies of the species interactions and site factors involved, in order to develop reforestation guidelines for a range of objectives and environmental settings.

"272","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","1. We examined effects of nutrients on leaf breakdown in interior forest streams at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We tested the hypothesis that dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) becomes limiting when ambient phosphorus (P) concentration is high. We also compared the breakdown of relatively 'low quality' leaves (lower C : N, Trema integerrima) with that of 'higher quality' leaves (higher C : N, Ficus insipida) in a high-P stream.
2. Litterbags were incubated in two streams: one enriched experimentally with P [target concentration 200 mu g soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) L-1] and one control (naturally low P concentration approximately 10 mu g SRP L-1). Ammonium enrichment was achieved by adding fertiliser upstream of half of the litterbags in each stream.
3. Phosphorus addition stimulated leaf breakdown, microbial respiration, ergosterol and leaf %P. Leaf breakdown rate was consistent with those in La Selva streams with naturally high P concentration.
4. Nitrogen (N) addition had no effect on leaf breakdown, microbial respiration, ergosterol or leaf chemistry in either the P-enriched or the reference stream, in spite of low N : P ratios. We conclude that N is probably not limiting in streams at La Selva that are naturally high in P. This may be due to moderately high ambient N concentration (> 200 mu g DIN L-1) prevailing throughout the year.
5. The species with a lower C : N decomposed more rapidly and supported higher microbial activity than that with a higher C : N. Subtle differences in leaf N content, as well as dissolved P concentration, may be important in determining microbial colonisation and subsequent leaf breakdown.","Stallcup, Lindsay A.

"273","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","There is growing interest in understanding the linkages between above- and belowground communities, and very little is known about these linkages in tropical systems. Using an experimental site at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we examined whether plant diversity, plant community composition, and season influenced microbial communities. We also determined whether soil characteristics were related to differences in microbial communities. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition revealed that microbial community composition differed across a plant diversity gradient (plots contained 1, 3, 5, or over 25 species). Plant species identity also was a factor influencing microbial community composition; PLFA composition significantly varied among monocultures, and among three-species combinations that differed in plant species composition. Differences among treatments within each of these comparisons were apparent in all four sampling dates of the study. There was no consistent shift in microbial community composition between wet and dry seasons, although we did see significant changes over time. Of all measured soil characteristics, soil C/N was most often associated with changes in microbial community composition across treatment groups. Our findings provide evidence for human alteration of soil microbial communities via the alteration of plant community composition and diversity and that such changes are mediated in part by changes in soil carbon quality.","Carney, Karen M.

"274","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Aim We studied pteridophyte species richness between 100 m and 3400 m along a Neotropical elevational gradient and tested competing hypotheses for patterns of species richness.
Location Elevational transects were situated at Volcan Barva in the Braulio Carrillo National Park and La Selva Biological Station (100-2800 m) and Cerro de la Muerte (2700-3400 m), both on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica, Central America. Method We analysed species richness on 156 plots of 20 x 20 m and measured temperature and humidity at four elevations (40, 650, 1800 and 2800 m). Species richness patterns were regressed against climatic variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation and actual evapotranspiration), regional species pool, area and predicted species number of a geometric null model (the mid-domain effect, MDE).
Results The species richness of the 484 recorded species showed a hump-shaped pattern with elevation with a richness peak at mid-elevations (c. 1700 m). The MDE was the single most powerful explanatory variable in linear regression models, but species richness was also associated strongly with climatic variables, especially humidity and temperature. Area and species pool were associated less strongly with observed richness patterns.
Main conclusions Geometric models and climatic models exclusive of geometric constraints explained comparable amounts of the elevational variation in species richness. Discrimination between these two factor complexes is not possible based on model fits. While overall fits of geometric models were high, large- and small-ranged species were explained by geometric models to different extents. Species with narrow elevational ranges clustered at both ends of the gradient to a greater extent than predicted by the MDE null models used here. While geometric models explained much of the pattern in species richness, we cannot rule out the role of climatic factors (or vice versa) because the predicted peak in richness from geometric models, the empirical peak in richness and the overlap in favourable environmental conditions all coincide at middle elevations. Mid-elevations offer highest humidity and moderate temperatures, whereas at high elevations richness is reduced due to low temperatures, and at low elevations by reduced water availability due to high temperatures.","Kluge, Juergen

"275","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Many conservation organizations have attempted to reduce local threats to protected areas (PAs) by providing environmental education programmes in neighbouring communities. There is a great need to understand the effectiveness of these programmes in promoting support for PAs and ultimately reducing threats to biodiversity. La Selva Biological Station, a private PA in Costa Rica, has become increasingly threatened by illegal hunting in the PA and deforestation and land degradation in surrounding areas. The Station has responded with several outreach projects including an annual free visiting day. This study used a survey instrument to evaluate the benefits of local residents visiting La Selva. Specifically, three questions were asked: (1) is there a difference in ecological knowledge of local residents among residents who have visited the Station and those that have not; (2) does an increase in knowledge relate to a perceived benefit from the PA; and (3) does recognition of a perceived benefit among local people result in fewer residents admitting to hunting or desiring to hunt in the PA? This study showed that those residents who had visited the station had a greater understanding of ecological concepts than those residents that had never been to the station, suggesting that such visits provided educational opportunities. Men also had greater ecological knowledge than women. Additionally, residents were more likely to value the PA if they had a greater knowledge of local ecology and conservation. Increased knowledge and recognition of perceived benefit however, do not necessarily translate into lifestyle changes that benefit conservation; no relationship was detected between residents who stated they benefited from the PA and those who said they did not have a desire to hunt, but younger respondents were more likely to express an interest in hunting than older respondents. The results presented here suggest that protected areas generally may benefit from visitation by local residents. However, further study is needed to determine if such outreach activities actually decrease local threats to conservation efforts, such as hunting.","Moorman, Randall S.","Moorman, RS",NA,"89",NA,NA,NA,"10.1017/S0376892906002955",NA,"99","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"JUN",NA,"J",NA,"2006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0376-8929","ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION",NA,"Benefits of local residents visiting La Selva Biological Station, Costa

Our study compares the performance of two such methods: manual sampling (light towers) and automatic sampling (funnel light traps). The abundance, diversity, and body size of moths representing two species-rich families (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae, Geometridae) were analyzed in a lowland rain forest in Costa Rica (La Selva Biological Station, 10.4 degrees N, 84.0 degrees W) during 2003 and 2004. Light towers were equipped with two 15-W UV fluorescent tubes and were operated for 3 h in 16 nights. Traps equipped with single 8-W fluorescent tubes were run throughout 20 nights in the understory of the forest. In addition, parallel trap sampling was carried out in the canopy. A total of 1,238 arctiid moths representing 162 species and 1,769 geometrid moths representing 196 species were collected. In Geometridae, tower samples were significantly larger than trap samples. Towers also attracted a higher overall number of species. Very small geometrids (particularly of the subfamily Sterrhinae) were under-represented in trap samples, suggesting that this method is biased toward larger species. In arctiid moths, there were no significant differences in either the sample sizes, the number of species or in the size of the individuals sampled. Diversity calculated as Fisher's a was similar for towers and understory traps in both families. A major component of diversity was added with canopy trap samples for arctiid moths, but not for geometrid moths. In conclusion, ground-based tower sampling proved to be the most suitable method for geometrid moths, and trap sampling including both understory and canopy for arctiid moths. For full moth species inventories, a combination of both approaches is recommended.","Brehm, Gunnar

"277","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","This paper reviews work related to interbasin groundwater flow (naturally occurring groundwater flow beneath watershed topographic divides) into lowland rainforest watersheds at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Chemical mixing calculations (based on dissolved chloride) have shown that up to half the water in some streams and up to 84% of the water in some riparian seeps and wells is due to high-solute interbasin groundwater flow (IGF). The contribution is even greater for major ions; IGF accounts for well over 90% of the major ions at these sites. Proportions are highly variable both among watersheds and with elevation within the same watershed (there is greater influence of IGF at lower elevations). The large proportion of IGF found in water in some riparian wetlands suggests that IGF is largely responsible for maintaining these wetlands. delta O-18 data support the conclusions from the major ion data. Annual water and major ion budgets for two adjacent watersheds, one affected by IGF and the other not, showed that IGF accounted for two-thirds of the water input and 92-99% of the major ion input (depending on the major ion in question) to the former watershed. The large (in some cases, dominating) influence of IGF on watershed surface water quantity and quality has important implications for stream ecology and watershed management in this lowland rainforest. Because of its high phosphorus content, IGF increases a variety of ecological variables (algal growth rates, leaf decay rate, fungal biomass, invertebrate biomass, microbial respiration rates on leaves) in streams at La Selva. The significant rates of IGF at La Selva also suggest the importance of regional (as opposed to small-scale local) water resource planning that links lowland watersheds with regional groundwater. IGF is a relatively unexplored and potentially critical factor in the conservation of lowland rainforest. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Genereux, DP

"279","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Stream physicochemistry and insect assemblages were studied in lowland tropical streams in Costa Rica to determine physicochemical variables explaining temporal and spatial variations in insect density and biomass. Streams drained a tropical wet forest landscape and had similar geomorphology, but differed in their water chemistry because of differential inputs of solute-rich (i.e., P, Cl-, and Mg) geothermally modified groundwater. We hypothesized that, within a stream, physical factors, such as discharge, would result in temporal variation in insect assemblages, whereas interstream differences in solute composition would result in differences in insect assemblages among streams. Insect density, biomass, richness, and stream physicochemistry were measured monthly for 1 y in 6 streams. Insect samples were collected with a core sampler in runs where leaf litter overlying fine sediments was the main substrate. Streams with high inputs of geothermally modified groundwater had high conductivity and high concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP). Annual temporal patterns in stream physicochemistry were related either to rainfall, with subsequent changes in discharge, or to the % geothermally modified groundwater entering streams. Streamwater pH decreased throughout the year and unbuffered, nongeothermally modified streams changed from near neutral (pH >6) to near acidic (pH <4.5). In all streams, insect density and biomass were highest during the dry season and lowest during the wet season. Insect density and biomass were related positively to pH and to the number of days since the last storm. Insect taxonomic composition was similar among streams. Moreover, interstream variation in insect assemblages was small, and insect density and biomass were not related to any of the measured physicochemical variables, including SRP, which ranged from <5 to 267 mu g/L. Overall, the physicochemical characteristics of the study streams were related mainly to geothermally modified groundwater inputs and seasonal patterns in rainfall. Streams with geothermally modified groundwater inputs were better buffered against pH changes than the other streams. Insect assemblages reflected fluctuations in stream physicochemistry during the year and were associated with 2 main factors: floods and pH. Physicochemical characteristics were very different among streams, but insect assemblages were not related to them. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous nature of benthic substrata in the streams resulted in high variation in density and biomass of insects, potentially obscuring differences in insect assemblages among streams.","Ramirez, A

We also examined whether differences among palm species in restricting seedling recruitment were associated with differences in crown architecture, litter depth, and light availability. Woody seedlings had lower mean density/m(2) and mean number of species/m(2) under individual palms than at non-palm sites for all four palm species at BCI, but for none at La Selva. Estimated species richness for woody seedlings, derived via rarefaction, was lower under palm than non-palm microsites at both BCI and La Selva, but not for non-woody seedlings. Differences in seedling density corresponded to some key architectural characters that differed among the palm species. Light availability was lower under palm than non-palm microsites at both BCI and La Selva, but only estimated species richness of woody seedlings at BCI was strongly correlated with % canopy openness. The coverage of arborescent palms was much lower at BCI than La Selva. Therefore, at BCI, the relative restriction of woody seedling recruitment under individual palms does not accumulate greatly at the landscape scale. At La Selva, for woody seedlings, only estimated species richness was relatively limited under palms, and non-woody seedlings had relatively lower mean density/m(2) and mean number of species/m(2) under only one palm species.

We used quantitative censuses and analysis of previously published categorical abundances to assess changes in the bird community, and we evaluated potential causes of species-specific changes by assessing their association with habitat, diet, participation in mixed-species flocks, and nest type. Approximately the same percentage of species increased as decreased in abundance from 1960 to 1999 (10-20% of all species, depending on method of assessment). Diet was the single most important trait associated with declining species. At least 50% of the species that declined have insectivorous diets. Use of forest habitat and participation in mixed-species flocks were also significant factors associated with declines, but nest type was unrelated to change in abundance. The species that increased in abundance tended to occur in open habitats and have omnivorous diets. These results reinforce the importance of several population risk factors associated with tropical understory insectivory and mixed-species flocking: patchy spatial distribution, low population density, large home range, and dietary specialization. La Selva's protected area (1611 ha), despite a forested connection on one boundary with a higher elevation national park, is apparently too small to maintain at least one major guild (understory insectivores). This first quantitative assessment of bird community change at La Selva highlights the need to intensify study of the mechanisms and consequences of biological diversity change in tropical forest fragments.","Sigel, BJ

Among the samples from all the sites combined, we found 264 species from 60 genera. Sixty-nine species were terrestrial, 113 were canopy epiphytes, and 121 were low-trunk epiphytes. Only one species occupied both canopy and terrestrial habitats at any of the study sites.

In contrast, the richness of terrestrial species rose to a mid-elevation maximum and remained relatively constant at higher elevations. In an effort to explain elevational patterns of species richness, we examined mean annual rainfall and temperature, light intensities in the canopy and at ground level, and the mid-domain effect. Of the explanatory factors examined, the mid-domain effect accounted for most of the elevational pattern.

Moreover, only one study has focused on scales below 10 km(2), where the effects of dispersal limitation are expected to be easiest to observe.
2 In the present study, we estimate the importance of differences in some key environmental variables (describing canopy openness, soils and topography) relative to the geographical distances between sample plots as determinants of differences in pteridophyte (ferns and fern allies) species composition between plots within a c. 5.7 km(2) lowland rain forest site in Costa Rica.
3 To assess the relative importance of environmental vs. geographical distances in relation to the length of environmental gradient covered, we compared the results obtained over the full range of soil types, including swamps, with those for upland soils alone.
4 Environmental variability was found to be a far stronger predictor of changes in floristic differences than the geographical distance between sample plots. In particular, differences in soil nutrient content, drainage and canopy openness correlated with floristic differences.
5 The decline in mean floristic similarity with increasing geographical distance was stronger than proposed by the random dispersal model over short distances (up to c. 100 m), which is probably attributable to both dispersal limitation and environmental changes. The scatter around the mean was large at all distances.
6 Our initial expectation was that the effects of dispersal limitation (represented by geographical distance) on observed patterns of floristic similarity would be stronger, and those of environmental differences weaker, than at broader spatial scales. Instead, these results suggest that the niche assembly view is a more accurate representation of pteridophyte communities at local to mesoscales than the dispersal assembly view.","Jones, MM

Little is known, however, about the factors that determine soil microbial community composition, and whether microbial community composition influences process rates. Here, we investigated whether aboveground plant diversity affects soil microbial community composition, and whether differences in microbial communities in turn affect ecosystem process rates. Using an experimental system at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we found that plant diversity (plots contained 1, 3, 5, or > 25 plant species) had a significant effect on microbial community composition (as determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis). The different microbial communities had significantly different respiration responses to 24 labile carbon compounds. We then tested whether these differences in microbial composition and catabolic capabilities were indicative of the ability of distinct microbial communities to decompose different types of litter in a fully factorial laboratory litter transplant experiment. Both microbial biomass and microbial community composition appeared to play a role in litter decomposition rates. Our work suggests, however, that the more important mechanism through which changes in plant diversity affect soil microbial communities and their carbon cycling activities may be through alterations in their abundance rather than their community composition.","Carney, KM

"286","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In plants that produce seeds with contrasting genetic background (selfed versus outcrossed), the question arises whether the ecological function of the two types of progeny differ. This paper addresses this issue for the ant-dispersed Calathea micans by introducing a novel application of the Neubert-Caswell model for analysis of wave speed for structured populations. Because dispersal as well as vital rates are structured, the model allows for distinct dispersal kernels for different types of progeny and thus permits comparisons of the sensitivity to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters of in situ population growth rate versus population spread across space. The study site was a lowland, evergreen tropical rain forest at La Selva Biological station, Costa Rica, where the species is commonly found throughout the forest. In C. inicans, seeds produced by open flowers (potentially outcrossed) or by closed flowers (selfed) bear oily arils and are dispersed by ants. Five life-history stages were used to characterize the population: seedlings originating from seeds produced by open flowers, seedlings originating from seeds produced by closed flowers, juvenile vegetative plants, reproductive plants without new shoots and reproductive plants with new shoots. Demography varied seasonally. Transitions were estimated from marking and following the fate of plants (N = 400) in a natural population over a dry and a wet season. The population dynamics was described by a 10 x 10 matrix, with five life-history stages and two habitat states. The habitat states cycle repeatedly, dry-wet-dry-wet. To estimate dispersal kernels for each seed type, individual seeds (N=225 and 306 seeds produced by open and closed flowers, respectively) were color-coded and placed in depots, allowing the ants to redistribute them. Five months later, seedlings with an attached seed coat bearing the intact color-coding, were surveyed around the depots. Radial distances and angles were recorded for each seedling (N= 67 and 81 seedlings arising from open and closed flowers, respectively). The results of the model give an asymptotic growth rate of 1.06 per season and an asymptotic rate of spread of 8.36 cm per season. There is a high correlation (r=0.99) between elasticity of growth rate and elasticity of rate of spread of the population. Both rates are most sensitive to changes in stasis of juveniles during the dry season. However, most interesting is the analysis that revealed that population spread is more sensitive than in situ population growth to demographic rates of seedlings arising from open flowers. The analysis suggests a new way of thinking about ecological functions of multiple modes of reproduction. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Le Corff, J

We used N-15 tracer additions to examine the effects of plantation establishment and management on gross N-cycling rates, N retention via microbial assimilation and dissimilatory nitrate (NO3-) reduction to ammonium (NH4+) (DNRA), and N losses via N2O emissions. In general, plantations had lower rates of N cycling and increased potential for N losses compared to old-growth forests, but there were few differences between very short (one-year) rotation and 10-yr-old uncut plantations. Gross N mineralization declined by almost 50% in the plantations compared to the old-growth forests, and much of the mineralized N was nitrified at all sites. Gross nitrification rates were more variable and did not differ between old-growth forests and unfertilized plantations; however, fertilization increased gross nitrification by a factor of 6 in short-rotation forests, signaling a potential mechanism for increased N losses via leaching and gaseous emissions. Old-growth forests had significantly higher microbial biomass N and NH4+ assimilation rates. No microbial N assimilation was measured in the plantation soils, nor was there evidence of gross NH4+ immobilization from estimates of NH4+ consumption and nitrification. Plantations and old-growth forests had similar DNRA rates (0.23 mu g(.)g(-1.)d(-1)), which retains N in the ecosystem, and plantations had lower N2O emissions. Nitrous oxide fluxes from plantations were highly sensitive to reducing conditions, highlighting the potential for high rates of NO losses. Our results show that plantation establishment can decrease rates of N cycling, but once forests are converted to plantations, internal N-cycling pathways and N2O fluxes are relatively resistant to disturbance associated with short rotation length.","Silver, WL

Forestry plots were 12 yr old and were either monocultures of three tree species, or polycultures of the tree species with two additional understory species. Relationships among the AM fungal spore community, host species, plant community diversity and ecosystem phosphorus-use efficiency (PUE) and net primary productivity (NPP) were assessed.
Analysis of the relative abundance of AM fungal spores found that host tree species had a significant effect on the AM fungal community, as did host plant community diversity (monocultures vs polycultures). The Shannon diversity index of the AM fungal spore community differed significantly among the three host tree species, but was not significantly different between monoculture and polyculture plots. Over all the plots, significant positive relationships were found between AM fungal diversity and ecosystem NPP, and between AM fungal community evenness and PUE. Relative abundance of two of the dominant AM fungal species also showed significant correlations with NPP and PUE.
We conclude that the AM fungal community composition in tropical forests is sensitive to host species, and provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that the diversity of AM fungi in tropical forests and ecosystem NPP covaries.","Lovelock, CE

Temperature and vapor pressure varied less in Hyeronima than in Lecythis crowns during the dry season. Microenvironmental conditions for epiphytes within Hyeronima crowns were more spatially and temporally homogeneous and were more buffered from ambient conditions than within Lecythis crowns.

We quantified and characterized fluxes of DOC, DON, and dissolved inorganic N (DIN) in throughfall, litter leachate, and soil solution of an old-growth tropical wet forest to assess their contribution to C stabilization (DOC) and to N export (DON and DIN) from this ecosystem. We found that the forest canopy was a major source of DOC (232 kg C ha(-1) y(-1)). Dissolved organic C fluxes decreased with soil depth from 277 kg C ha(-1) y(-1) below the litter layer to around 50 kg C kg C ha(-1) y(-1) between 0.75 and 3.5m depth. Laboratory experiments to quantify biodegradable DOC and DON and to estimate the DOC sorption capacity of the soil, combined with chemical analyses of DOC, revealed that sorption was the dominant process controlling the observed DOC profiles in the soil. This sorption of DOC by the soil matrix has probably led to large soil organic C stores, especially below the rooting zone. Dissolved N fluxes in all strata were dominated by mineral N (mainly NO3(3)(-)). The dominance of NO3- relative to the total amount nitrate of N leaching from the soil shows that NO3- is dominant not only in forest ecosystems receiving large anthropogenic nitrogen inputs but also in this old-growth forest ecosystem, which is not N-limited.","Schwendenmann, L

Results: Significant, but weak, distance decay is found. After correcting for known patterns of environmental heterogeneity, the distance decay almost disappears, except for fine spatial scales.
Conclusions: These results are inconsistent with models that predict distance decay at all spatial scales.

Some authors suggest a function in reducing splash soil erosion, leaching or substances from the leaf, and light reflectance, while other studies did not rind any such correlations. We used an experimental approach to test for the effect of drip-tips on the development of epiphyllous lichen communities. Artificial leaves with and without pronounced drip-tips were exposed in a tropical lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station (Costa Rica) for a period of 38 mo, and the physical behaviour of rainwater was tested. On leaves with drip-tips, the water ran off in small, frequent drops 8-30 mm(3) in size. On leaves without drip-tips, the water accumulated in the apex region and dripped off periodically in large drops 50-150 mm(3) in size. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the development of epiphyllous lichen communities on leaves with and without drip-tips, in terms of area covered, species richness and composition. However. leaves without drip-tips had more debris accumulated in the apex region and, at the same time, fewer lichen species present in this region. Thus. while drip-tips do have an influence on how water is channclled off the leaf surface, they do not impair the development of epiphyllous lichen communities, except for the apex region where the presence of drip-tips does in fact enhance, not reduce, the establishment of lichens, by preventing the accumulation of debris. We conclude that, while drip-tips may have an ecological function, this function is unrelated to the development of epiphyllous lichen communities.","Lucking, R

AcromyrTnex volcanus is known from the Atlantic side of Costa Rica and Nicaragua up to an elevation of 1000 m. Previous studies found that mature A. volcanus colonies have fewer than 20,000 workers, commonly nest in trees, and primarily harvest the leaves of herbaceous plants and fallen leaves, fruit, and flowers.

We examined foraging at seven A. volcanus colonies and discerned no consistent differences in foraging selectivity between day and night, nor between wet and dry season.

Dwarf palms in some Neotropical forests dominate the understory strata, and their umbrella-like architecture may intensify understory shade and make the site less suitable for seedling regeneration. In this study we surveyed seedlings under dwarf palms in four habitats at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We compared seedling recruitment in both 2001 and 2002 at non-palm microsites vs microsites under 1) tall dwarf palms, 2) short dwarf palms, and 3) short palms surrounded by dwarf palms. Light environments at non-palm and under-palm sites were quantified with hemispherical photos. Seedling growth, survivorship, density, and species richness all differed significantly among microsites, and were all greatest at non-palm sites and lowest at dense palm sites. Overall, seedling growth, survivorship, density, and species richness were 30%, 50%, 50%, and 40%, respectively, less at under-palm than at nonpalm sites. The main restriction by dwarf palms occurred on post-cotyledonous and woody seedlings. Percent canopy openness differed among microsites, and was greatest at non-palm sites and lowest at dense palm sites. However, seedling responses were only weakly correlated with percent canopy openness. These results revealed significant reduction in seedling recruitment under individual dwarf palms, with greatest negative effects where a palm was surrounded by palms. Dwarf palms occur at high density (2611 individuals/ha) and cover 21% of the understory in the four habitats (alluvium, residual flat area, residual slope area, swamp) of the primary forest. Therefore, this negative impact by individual dwarf palms is significant at the landscape scale as well, based on the great dwarf palm density and coverage in the four habitats.","Wang, YH

V guatemalensis has a rotation age of 13.5 years producing 417 m(3)/ha, and V ferruginea has a rotation age of 13.3 years producing 363 m(3)/ha.
J copaia and V guatemalensis grew significantly faster in mixed plantations than in pure plantations. A mixed-species plantation comprised of J. copaia, V guatemalensis, and Calophyllum brasiliense Cambess produces 21% more total volume of merchantable timber than a pure plantation of J copaia, which grows the fastest of the three species. Restoring abandoned agricultural sites with V guatemalensis will yield the most timber to landowners after one rotation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","Petit, B

The nest of this species is different from that of many other independent-founding polistines, in that it has a distinctly horizontal petiole and outward-facing cells (rather than a vertical petiole and downward-facing cells). Nests were sometimes situated on vertical surfaces, but were most often attached to the underside of a substrate leaning up to 20 from vertical. A few nests (about 6%) were found on buildings, but most were found on trees with smooth, peeling, or flaking bark. The four tree species found most commonly to bear nests were Psidium guajava, Cecropia obtusifolia, Vochysia guatemalensis, and Bactris gasipaes. Nests were found on tree trunks and primary branches, never on foliage or twigs. Median nest heights above ground were 250-350 cm, ranging from under 50 to over 850 cm. A systematic search of trees in an area of known high nest density demonstrated that even experienced searchers may miss at least 27% of nests in a given area.

Using a set of study systems in Costa Rica, we examined whether plant diversity or land-use influenced AOB diversity or composition and whether AOB diversity or composition were associated with nitrification rates. We characterized the molecular diversity and composition of AOB via polymerase chain reaction amplification, cloning, and sequencing of 16S rDNA. We found that AOB diversity or composition did not change significantly across plant diversity treatments. In contrast, AOB differed among land-use types in some measures of diversity and in composition, and differences in AOB composition among land-use types were correlated with potential rates of nitrification. Our results suggest that anthropogenic changes of ecosystems can alter microbial communities in ways that may affect the processes they mediate.","Carney, KM

Mutualistic species confer a benefit to the plant, while parasites reap the benefits of the interaction without reciprocating, potentially resulting in a negative impact on the host plant. Using the ant-plant symbiosis between Cordia alliodora and its ant inhabitants as a model system, I examine the costs and benefits of habitation by the four most common ant inhabitants at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Costs are measured by counting coccoids associated with each ant species. Benefits include patrolling behavior, effectiveness at locating resources, and recruitment response. I also compare the diets of the four ant species using stable isotope analysis of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C). Ants varied in their rates of association with coccoids, performance of beneficial behaviors, and diet. These differences in cost, benefit, and diet among the ant species suggest differences in the nature of the symbiotic relationship between C. alliodora and its ants. Two of the ant species behave in a mutualistic manner, while the other two ant species appear to be parasites of the mutualism. I determined that the mutualistic ants feed at a higher trophic level than the parasitic ants. Behavioral and dietary evidence indicate the protective role of the mutualists, and suggest that the parasitic ants do not protect the plant by consuming herbivores.","Tillberg, CV","Tillberg, CV",NA,"506",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s00442-004-1601-8",NA,"515","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"AUG",NA,"J",NA,"2004",NA,NA,"15179580",NA,NA,"0029-8549","OECOLOGIA",NA,"Friend or foe?

Natural and anthropogenic disturbances have important and lasting influences on ecosystem structure and fluxes that can be difficult to detect or assess with conventional methods. In this study, we combined two recent advances in remote sensing and ecosystem modeling to improve model carbon stock and flux estimates at a tropical forest study site at La Selva, Costa Rica (10degrees25' N, 84degrees00' W). Airborne lidar remote sensing was used to measure spatial heterogeneity in the vertical structure of vegetation. The ecosystem demography model (ED) was used to estimate the consequences of this heterogeneity for regional estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes. Lidar data provided substantial constraints on model estimates of both carbon stocks and net carbon fluxes. Lidar-initialized ED estimates of above ground biomass were within 1.2% of regression-based approaches, and corresponding model estimates of net carbon fluxes differed substantially from bracketing alternatives. The results of this study provide a promising illustration of the power of combining lidar data on vegetation height with a height-structured ecosystem model. Extending these analyses to larger scales will require the development of regional and global lidar data sets, and the continued development and application of height structured ecosystem models.","Hurtt, GC

To analyse guild structure and mechanisms of coexistence in a Costa Rican tropical lowland rainforest, the resource use and morphology of bats were compared to the energetic characteristics of preferred nectar resources and their spatio-temporal distribution. The relative abundance of nectar-feeding bats was determined from mistnet captures over 26 months. Food items were identified by analysis of pollen loads and faecal samples. Phenology, flower density and nectar sugar content of resource plants permitted quantitative estimations of resource availability expressed as energy density (kJ ha(-1) day(-1)) throughout the annual cycle. Four glossophagine bat species co-occurred at La Selva: two permanent residents (Glossophaga commissarisi, Hylonycteris underwoodi) and two seasonal species (Lichonycteris obscura, Lonchophylla robusta) that were found in small numbers during a period of high nectar availability. The two resident species differed in their abundance and in their temporal feeding strategies. After the main flowering peak, the common G. commissarisi shifted to a more frugivorous diet, while the rarer H. underwoodi fed on the few remaining bat-flowers. Resource plant species differed in their energy density by up to two orders of magnitude. Hylonycteris underwoodi visited more often plant species with a low energy yield than G. commissarisi. Because of its smaller body size and a wing morphology that promotes fast flight, H. underwoodi appears to be better adapted to low and scattered nectar resource levels. The two seasonal species differed greatly in body mass, which suggests different strategies for high-quality resource tracking. Large body mass in Lonchophylla robusta provides an energy buffer that permits daily commuting flights between a permanent roost and profitable foraging areas, while the small Lichonycteris obscura seems to track resources nomadically. It is proposed that energy density may be a major niche dimension that restricts access of species to certain habitats and that may profoundly influence the structure of nectar-feeding bat guilds.","Tschapka, M","Tschapka, M",NA,"7",NA,NA,NA,"10.1017/S0952836903004734",NA,"21","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAY",NA,"J",NA,"2004","Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0952-8369","JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY",NA,"Energy density patterns of nectar resources permit coexistence within a

A simple model was developed to predict tree sap flow responses to a synthetic environmental variable generated by a principle components analysis. The best fit was obtained with a sigmoid function which explained between 74 and 93% of the variation in sap flux of individual trees. Sap flow reached an asymptote where higher light and evaporative demand did not cause sap flux to increase further. Soil moisture had little influence on sap flux. The morphological characteristics of the trees significantly affected sap flow; taller trees responded to changes in environmental variables sooner than shorter trees and high liana cover buffered tree sap flow responses to weather. The effect of species-specific differences on the model was small; the mean effectiveness of the model was reduced by 6% when parameters were estimated from a single pool of measurements taken from all individuals. The results indicate that sap flow response could be effectively estimated using a simple general model and composite environmental index for these 10 diverse tree species.","O'Brien, JJ

2 Mean levels of glomalin in the top 10 cm of the La Selva soils were 3.94 +/- 0.16 mg cm(-3) (1.45 Mg C ha(-1)), accounting for approximately 3.2% of total soil C and 5% of soil nitrogen (N) in the 0-10 cm soil layer.
3 More fertile soils with higher concentrations of calcium, phosphorus and potassium had less glomalin, while the less fertile soils, those with high C : N ratios and high levels of iron and aluminium, had more glomalin.
4 We found higher levels of immunoreactivity, which is characteristic of young, recently produced glomalin, in the soils with higher concentrations of calcium, phosphorus and potassium.

Only lipase, among the digestive enzymes, exhibited the unexpected outcome of either not differing significantly in activity (per g of tissue) between juveniles and larger fish or being significantly higher (per mg of protein) in larger fish.

We measured, identified, permanently marked, and mapped all lianas greater than or equal to1.3 m in length and 2 mm in diameter, whether climbing or free-standing, in nine, 24 m x 36 m (864 m(2)) plots. There were no significant differences in density, diversity, or mortality between primary forest and areas that were selectively logged approximately 50 years prior to 2 our study. We found a mean density of 1493 lianas ha(-1) and a mean species richness of 23 species per 864 m(2) plot. Annual mortality was 9.4% over all size-classes, but was the highest for the smallest individuals (<2 cm in diameter). Annual mortality for larger individuals (greater than or equal to5 cm) was much lower over the 3.5-year period (3.2% per year) and the five most abundant species suffered no mortality in this size-class. In contrast to many lowland neotropical forests, where Bignoniaceae and Fabaceae are reported to be the dominant liana families, at La Selva we found that Sapindaceae was the most speciose family and Dilleniaceae the most abundant. Moutabea aculeata (Polygalaceae) was the most abundant species, constituting approximately 17% of the individuals and having the lowest mortality of all 60 species. The 10 most abundant species at La Selva accounted for more than 60% of all individuals. Compared to other lowland sites in the neotropics, including other wet forests, the abundance and diversity of lianas at La Selva are very low. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

"315","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","We contrasted the structure and biomass of four lowland Neotropical forests (La Selva, Costa Pica; Barro Colorado Island, Panama; Cocha Cashu, Peru; and KM41, Brazil) to determine if commonalities exist within and among forests differing in latitude, rainfall, seasonality, and soil fertility. We examined the effect of soil fertility specifically by measuring the density and basal area of trees, lianas, and palms on two soil types differing in fertility at each site. We used allometric relationships to estimate the contribution of the various life-forms to total aboveground biomass (AGB) and compared two relationships for trees 30 cm diameter or greater. Estimated liana density and AGB were similar among sites, but the density and AGB of trees and palms, estimated using diameter alone, differed significantly. Basal area and AGB of trees 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) or greater differed among forests and averaged 30.2 m(2)/ha and 250 Mg/ha, respectively. Cocha Cashu and KM41 had higher tree basal area and AGB than La Selva or Barro Colorado Island. Across forests, lianas and small trees (1-10 cm DBH) each contributed between 4 and 5 percent of the total AGB and small palms contributed ca I percent. Many forest inventories ignore lianas, as well as trees and palms less than 10 cm DBH, and therefore underestimate AGB by ca 10 percent. Soil type had little influence on the forest structure within sites, except at Cocha Cashu where total AGB was much higher and liana density much lower on the more fertile old floodplain Entisols than the terra firme Oxisols. Although total stem density basal area, and some biomass components differed significantly among forests, they seemed less variable than other quantitative measures (e.g., species richness).","DeWalt, SJ

I investigated interspecific and inter-site variation in wood specific gravity-an easily measured indicator of tree life history strategy-in four Neotropical forests and analyzed its correlates. Mean wood specific gravity (oven-dry weight divided by fresh volume, sometimes also referred to as wood density in the literature) differed significantly among sites, varying inversely with soil fertility and independently of rainfall, seasonality and temperature. Mean wood specific gravity values were much higher at Kilometer 41, Manaus, Brazil, where soils are extremely poor, than at Cocha Cashu, Peru, Barro Colorado Island, Panama, or La Selva, Costa Rica, where soils are better and mortality rates of trees are higher. Within sites, wood specific gravity varied widely among species. On Barro Colorado Island, among-species variation was significantly, albeit weakly, negatively correlated with sapling and tree mortality and relative growth rates. Altogether, the results suggest that the distribution of tree life history strategies in a community varies substantially among sites, with important consequences for community and ecosystem properties such as aboveground carbon stores.","Muller-Landau, HC","Muller-Landau, HC",NA,"20",NA,NA,NA,"10.1111/j.1744-7429.2004.tb00292.x",NA,"32","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAR",NA,"J",NA,"2004",NA,"Muller-Landau, Helene/0000-0002-3526-9021",NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"Interspecific and inter-site variation in wood specific gravity of

Understanding what generates variation in understory light availability represents one step in understanding processes regulating seedling banks, the beginning capital of regeneration in tropical forests. Near the forest floor, variation in light availability may be strongly influenced by the structure and composition of the understory. I examined abundance of understory foliage and patterns of light attenuation in five Neotropical forests (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica = LS; Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama = BCI; Cocha Cashu Biological Station, Mann National Park, Peru = CC; Kilometer 41, Manaus, Brazil = KM41; and Nouragues, French Guiana = NG). I used hemispherical canopy photos to estimate light availability at two heights (0.65 and 1.7 m) above the forest floor and counted foliage between these heights. Light availability differed significantly among sites, and site rankings depended on measurement height. At 0.65 m, NG had significantly lower mean light availability than CC, with KM41, LS, and BCI equivalent and intermediate. At 1.7 m, light availability was still lowest at NG, and highest at CC, but LS had levels similar to CC while KM41 and BCI remained intermediate. Across sites, light attenuation was positively related to foliage density. LS had the most understory foliage and the highest light attenuation between 0.65 and 1.7 In. KM41, NG and CC had intermediate amounts of foliage and intermediate light attenuation. BCI had the lowest density of understory foliage and no difference between light at the two measurement heights. My results show significant effects of understory foliage on understory light and indicate that the selective environment of canopy tree seedlings differs among sites.","Montgomery, RA","Montgomery, RA",NA,"33",NA,NA,NA,"10.1646/02118",NA,"39","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAR",NA,"J",NA,"2004","Montgomery, Rebecca/J-5774-2013","Montgomery, Rebecca/0000-0002-4131-1847",NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"Effects of understory foliage on patterns of light attenuation near the

We used standardized transect-based methods to compare small sapling densities (10-50 cm tall), understory vegetation cover, canopy openness, and nutrient availability in non-gap portions of four lowland Neotropical forests: La Selva, Costa Rica (LS), Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), Cocha Cashu, Peru (CC), and north of Manaus, Brazil (KM41). Sites differed significantly in all variables except canopy openness. LS had high palm and non-fern herb cover and low density of small saplings (0.7-1.6/m(2)) compared to other sites. CC had high fern cover, whereas BCI had low cover in all small categories: of understory vegetation (palms, ferns, and non-fern herbaceous plants). BCI, CC, and KM41 had similar I sap ling densities, ranging from 4.8-7.5/m(2). Within each forest, cation (Ca, Mg, K, and Na) availability was usually higher on more fertile soil orders (Inceptisols, Alfisols, and Entisols) than on more weathered soil types (Ultisols and Oxisols). Extractable P was highest at LS and CC and lowest on BCI (no data for KM41). Spatial autocorrelation was present for some variables in some transects to distances beyond our detection ability (>25 m). Understory palm cover was negatively correlated with small sapling density at fine (1 m(2) quadrat) and coarse spatial scales (among forests), although across forests the effect of palms was due entirely to the difference between LS and the other three forests. These results provide cross-site support for the hypothesis that understory cover by palms decreases the density of small saplings that comprise the advance regeneration of the forest.","Harms, KE

Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to assess the relative importance of the landscape and environmental factors in controlling the presence in gaps of Cecropia species that are typical of secondary forests regenerating after large-scale disturbances. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an ordination technique based on pioneer species composition of each gap. The PCA ordination axes were regressed against soil type, gap size, forest type, and distance values of each site to explore the relationship between composition and control factors. At the four sites, the variable best correlated to the discriminant function of gaps with and without Cecropia was the distance to secondary forests, although such discriminant function was statistically significant at only one site. In three of the four sites (with the exception of BCI, where there are no typical young secondary forests), distance to secondary forests was correlated with at least one axis of the PCA (P < 0.06). Other significant correlations included soil variables (CC and KM41), gap size (KM41), and forest type (secondary vs. primary; BCI). Overall, the results provide some support for the hypothesis that at the spatial scale of this study, distance to young secondary forests (both natural and anthropogenic) influences treefall gap composition at a level comparable to endogenous and exogenous microenvironmental factors.","Grau, HR","Grau, HR",NA,"52",NA,NA,NA,"10.1646/02116",NA,"59","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAR",NA,"J",NA,"2004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"Landscape context and local-scale environment influence regeneration of

"320","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Understanding the current status of the world's tropical rain forests (TRF) can be greatly advanced by global coverage of remotely sensed data at the scale of individual tree crowns. In 1999 the IKONOS satellite began offering worldwide 1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral data. Here we show that these data can be used to address diverse aspects of forest ecology and land-use classification in the tropics.
Using crowns of emergent trees as control points, we georeferenced a 600-ha subset of IKONOS 1-m and 4-m data from an August 2000 image of the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica (root mean square error = 4.3 m). Crown area measured on the image was highly correlated with crown area for the same tree measured from the ground. Using a 1988 aerial photograph as a baseline, all trees >1 m diameter in a long-term study that died over the ensuing 12-year period, and that could be located in the photograph, were detected as missing in the IKONOS image (N = 7). Crown growth for large trees visible on both images averaged 12 m(2)/yr (N = 16). We thus demonstrate that IKONOS imagery can provide data on four variables necessary for doing demographic research: tree size, location, mortality, and growth.
Stand basal area, estimated aboveground biomass, and percentage of the canopy >15 m tall for 18 0.5-ha permanent forest inventory plots in old growth were all highly significantly correlated with different indices derived from the IKONOS data.
We used summary statistics from the original IKONOS data as well as derived indices to characterize nine areas with well-documented land-use histories. Secondary forests were clearly separable from the other sites. One of the secondary forests was 40 years old, suggesting that IKONOS data can be used to detect significantly older secondary forest than is possible with coarser resolution satellite data. The selectively logged forest was distinguishable by measuring the size of the largest crowns on the 1-m image. This suggests a range of applications for detecting and quantifying biomass degradation due to selective logging and edge effects.
Satellite data at 1-m and 4-m resolution make possible a truly global approach to fine spatial resolution remote-sensing studies of TRF ecology and land use.","Clark, DB

A forest section with an area of 1.6 ha composed of 71 adjacent plots was located on a slope ending at the river margin. The section was divided into five topographical sectors according to the mean duration of river floods. In 1991 and 1998 all trees with a diameter at the base of the trunk greater than or equal to 5 cm were measured, identified and tagged, and all live bamboo culms were counted. Annualised estimates of the rates of tree mortality and recruitment, gain and loss of tree basal area, and change in bamboo density were calculated for each of the 71 plots and five topographical sectors as well as for diameter classes and tree species. To segregate patterns arising from spatially autocorrelated events, geostatistical analyses were used prior to statistical comparisons and correlations. In general, mortality rates were not compensated by recruitment rates but there was a net increase in basal area in all sectors, suggesting that the tree community as a whole was in a building phase. Tree community dynamics of the point bar forest (Depression and Levee sectors) differed from that of the upland forest (Ridgetop, Middle Slope and Lower Slope sectors) in the extremely high rates of gain in basal area. The predominant and specialised species, Inga vera and Salix humboldtiana, are probably favoured by relaxed competition in an environment stressed by long-lasting floods. In the upland forest, mortality rates were highest at the Middle Slope, particularly for smaller trees, while recruitment rates were lowest. As bamboo clumps were concentrated in this sector, the locally higher instability in the tree community probably resulted from the direct interference of bamboos. The density of bamboo culms in the upland forest was negatively correlated with the rates of tree recruitment and gain in basal area, and positively correlated with tree mortality rates. Bamboos therefore seemed to restrict the recruitment, growth and survival of trees.","Guilherme, FAG

We collected samples from the trunks, of 29 fallen, dead individuals. We found that all eight sampled species formed visible growth rings, which varied considerably in distinctiveness. For five of the six species for which we combined wood anatomical studies with C-14-dates (ring ages), the analyses demonstrated that growth rings were of annual formation. The oldest tree we found by direct ring counting was a Hymenolobium mesoamericanum Lima (Papilionaceae) specimen, with an age of ca. 530 years at the time of death. All other sampled individuals, including very large trees of slow-growing species, had died at ages between 200 and 300 years. These results show that, even in an everwet tropical rain forest, tree growth of many species can be rhythmic, with an annual periodicity. This study thus raises the possibility of extending tree-ring analyses throughout the tropical forest types lacking a strong dry season or annual flooding. Our findings and similar measurements from other tropical forests indicate that the maximum ages of tropical emergent trees are unlikely to be much greater than 600 years, and that these trees often die earlier from various natural causes.","Fichtler, E

"329","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","The mating behaviour of Staminodeus vectoris Franz (Curculionidae: Curculioninae: Derelomini) is described and discussed in light of a phylogeny of Staminodeus Franz. At La Selva, Costa Rica, S. vectoris is associated with the staminodes of the inflorescences of Asplundia uncinata Harling and several other species of Cyclanthaceae. The males have a row of 6-10 teeth along the margin of the protibia, whereas the females have a small, curved spine on the frons. The adults arrive in numbers at the inflorescences during the pistillate phase of the anthesis of A. uncinata , feeding on the staminodes. Eventually, a female detaches a staminode with her mandibles, falls to the ground, and transports it to the site of oviposition in the leaf litter. First, she crawls underneath the staminode, then moves it posteriorly with her legs, and finally returns to its distal end before repeating the process. The female turns on her back and maintains her original position during the movement of the staminode, using her frontal spine as a point of resistance against the substrate. Meanwhile, a male associates with the staminode. The males fight with their prothoracic legs, executing fast blows until their protibial teeth cling and dislodge competitors from the staminode. The positive and negative allometries of the lengths of the male protibia and female spine, are consistent with their functions in the contexts of sexual and natural selection, respectively. The phylogeny of all seven species of Staminodeus hypothesises that female transporting behaviour evolved before male fighting behaviour.","Franz, NM","Franz, NM",NA,"1727",NA,NA,NA,"10.1080/00222930210130348",NA,"1750","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"JUL",NA,"J",NA,"2003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-2933","JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY",NA,"Mating behaviour of Staminodeus vectoris (Coleoptera : Curculionidae),

"330","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Based on data from observations of 302 tree species at La Selva, Costa Rica, we tested a range of hypotheses about the relationship between flowering parameters such as time, frequency, and duration and ecological features such as successional status, habit, sexual systems, and pollen vectors with and without considering the effect of family membership. We predicted that early successional species would flower any time of the year, but species pollinated by different vectors as well as dioecious species would flower nonrandomly across seasons. However, there was little evidence that flowering time varied with successional status, pollen vectors, and sexual systems. As we predicted, supra-annual flowering was proportionately less common in early successional species as compared to late ones, in understory species as compared to canopy species, and in dioecious species as compared to those with hermaphroditic flowers. When considering phylogeny, however, supra-annual flowering in the understory was not as rare as predicted. Our prediction of longer flowering in the early successional species as compared to late successional species was also supported. Predictions about longer flowering of dioecious species as compared to hermaphroditic species and of species pollinated by generalist vectors as compared to the specialists were not supported, though there was a trend in the expected direction.","Kang, H

We measured soil CO2 efflux from eight permanent soil chambers on six Oxisol sites. Three sites were developed on old river terraces ('old alluvium') and the other three were developed on old lava flows ('residual'). At the same time we measured soil CO2 concentrations, soil water content and soil temperature at various depths in 6 soil shafts (3 m deep). Between 'old alluvium' sites, the two-year average CO2 flux rates ranged from 117.3 to 128.9 mg C m(-2) h(-1). Significantly higher soil CO2 flux occurred on the 'residual' sites (141.1 to 184.2 mg C m(-2) h(-1)). Spatial differences in CO2 efflux were related to fine root biomass, soil carbon and phosphorus concentration but also to soil water content. Spatial variability in CO2 storage was high and the amount of CO2 stored in the upper and lower soil profile was different between 'old alluvial' and 'residual' sites. The major factor identified for explaining temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux was soil water content. During periods of high soil water content CO2 emission decreased, probably due to lower diffusion and CO2 production rates. During the 2-year study period inter-annual variation in soil CO2 efflux was not detected.","Schwendenmann, L

The cause was hypothesized to be frequent cyclone disturbances. We compared the structure of the lowland rain forests in Madagascar to the structure described in published accounts of other tropical lowland rain forests. We found that the eastern coastal lowland forests of Madagascar have short canopy heights relative to that of many other lowland tropical rain forests, and that these Malagasy forests also have relatively high tree densities. On a worldwide basis, there is a significant correlation between short forest canopies and occurrence of tropical cyclones. The association between high tree density and occurrence of tropical cyclones is valid for Africa, but the pattern does not hold up globally.","de Gouvenain, RC

The trees' annual diameter increments in this 16-yr period were negatively correlated with annual means of daily minimum temperatures. The tree growth variations also negatively covaried with the net carbon exchange of the terrestrial tropics as a whole, as inferred from nearly pole-to-pole measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) interpreted by an inverse tracer-transport model. Strong reductions in tree growth and large inferred tropical releases of CO2 to the atmosphere occurred during the record-hot 1997-1998 El Ni (n) over tildeo. These and other recent findings are consistent with decreased net primary production in tropical forests in the warmer years of the last two decades. As has been projected by recent process model studies, such a sensitivity of tropical forest productivity to on-going climate change would accelerate the rate of atmospheric CO2 accumulation.","Clark, DA

We assessed the composition and distribution of epiphytic bromeliad communities in four- and eight-year-old replicated experimental monospecific tree plantations (3 species) at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The bromeliad communities of these stands are dominated by two species, Guzmania monostachya (L.) Rusby ex. Mez and Vriesea gladioliflora (H. Wendl.) Antoine. We identified bromeliads on over 700 trees and estimated their biomass and leaf area. Mean bromeliad biomass ranged from 2 to 8 g/tree in the four-year-old plots and from 20 to 94 g/tree in the eight-year-old plots. The mean bromeliad leaf area ranged between 104 and 704 cm(2)/tree and from 1600 to 8500 cm(2)/tree in the four- and eight-year-old plots, respectively. Although bromeliads accounted for less than 2 percent of the total foliar biomass and leaf area in both four-year-old and eight-year-old plots, the biomass of bromeliads exhibited a 5- to 46-fold increase between the four-year-old and eight-year-old plots, respectively. Bromeliads showed clear patterns of host tree preference, which may be attributed to host tree characteristics that differentially favor recruitment and survivorship. Between four and eight years of growth, differences among host tree species with respect to the amount of available host tree woody biomass, host tree foliar biomass, and host tree leaf surface area were positively correlated with the abundance of epiphytic bromeliads.","Merwin, MC

The study was conducted in Costa Rica at the La Selva Biological Field Station (50 m elev.), Las Cruces Biological Field Station (1200 m), Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve (1500 m), and Cuerici Biological Field Station (2600 m). At each site, 20 tree fern trunks with a root mantle were sampled for epiphytes up to a height of 3 m, and the same was done for the nearest angiosperm trunk of similar diameter at breast height (DBH). A total of 106 species of epiphytic ferns was found at all of the study sites; none occurred more frequently on angiosperm trunks, but 11 occurred more frequently on tree ferns. Seven of the 11 species were entirely restricted to tree ferns, whereas the other 4 also occurred on angiosperms. Tree ferns had a significantly higher number of epiphytic species than angiosperms, averaging (depending on the site) 3-5 species, whereas angiosperms averaged 1 or 2. Epiphytic ferns were more abundant on tree ferns than on angiosperms. No correlation existed, for tree ferns or for angiosperms, between DBH and species richness or percent cover of fern epiphytes. In conclusion, low-trunk fern epiphytes exhibited significant differences on tree fern versus angiosperm in regard to species composition, number of species per trunk, and percent cover. The differences probably were caused by the root mantles providing more favorable microhabitats for the establishment of fern prothalli and a better substrate for the attachment of fern sporophytes.","Moran, RC

Seven pollinators (hummingbirds) and four robbers (I hummingbird and 3 perching birds) comprised the avian nectarivorous guild visiting H. patens during March 1997. In addition, two florivorous birds were observed visiting H. patens during the study. Pollinators accounted for 85.6 percent of the visits, robbers for 12.4 percent, and florivores for 2 percent of the visits. Visitation by pollinators and robbers was greatest when floral nectar was highest. No aggressive interactions between pollinators and robbers were observed during the study. Pollinators differed in their ability to carry and deposit pollen on the stigma. Territorial hummingbirds were the least effective pollinators but the most frequent visitors. Flowers were frequently robbed (71%) during the study. Flowers experimentally robbed did not increase nectar production compared to control flowers; therefore, robbery may not involve an extra energy investment in terms of nectar production. The number of pollen grains deposited on artificially robbed flowers was significantly less than the number found in flowers with extra nectar (nectar added) but did not differ from the number found in non-manipulated flowers, indicating that nectar robbers may not affect the foraging behavior of hummingbirds, and therefore pollen deposition.","Lasso, E

During the course of a day, average and maximum wind speeds were highest in the morning and midday, and lowest at night. Wind speeds under the canopy were highest near the top of the canopy and were lowest near the canopy floor in the morning and afternoon, and exhibited little variation with respect to height at night. Turbulence intensity (a common measure of gustiness) was constant (ca 1) for all times of day, heights in the canopy, and sites, but the absolute magnitudes of wind gust speeds were higher during the day than at night. Power spectral densities revealed that most of the variation in wind speeds occurred at frequencies that could potentially affect the gliding of tree frogs. Tree frogs (and many other gliding animals), however, glide at night and thereby avoid the higher wind speeds that occur by day. Computer simulations of the dynamic motions of frogs while gliding revealed that the night levels of wind gusts have little effect on the direction of gliding of tree frogs.","McCay, MG","McCay, MG",NA,"94",NA,NA,NA,"10.1646/0006-3606(2003)035[0094:WUTRFC]2.0.CO;2",NA,"102","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAR",NA,"J",NA,"2003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"Winds under the rain forest canopy: The aerodynamic environment of

Whether tropical forests are sources, sinks, or neutral with respect to their carbon balance with the atmosphere remains unclear. To address this issue, estimates of net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) were made for 3 years (1998-2000) using the eddy-covariance technique in a tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. Measurements were made from a 42 m tower centred in an old-growth forest. Under unstable conditions, the measurement height was at least twice the estimated zeroplane height from the ground. The canopy at the site is extremely rough; under unstable conditions the median aerodynamic roughness length ranged from 2.4 to 3.6 m. No relationship between NEE and friction velocity (u*) was found using all of the 30-min averages. However, there was a linear relationship between the nighttime NEE and averaged u* (R-2 = 0.98). The diurnal pattern of flux was similar to that found in other tropical forests, with mean daytime NEE ca. - 18 mumol CO(2)m(-2)s(-1) and mean nighttime NEE 4.6 mumol CO(2)m(-2)s(-1). However, because similar to 80% of the nighttime data in this forest were collected during low u* conditions (< 0.2 m s(-1)), nighttime NEE was likely underestimated. Using an alternative analysis, mean nighttime NEE increased to 7.05 &mu;mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1). There were interannual differences in NEE, but seasonal differences were not apparent. Irradiance accounted for &SIM; 51% of the variation in the daytime fluxes, with temperature and vapour pressure deficit together accounting for another &SIM; 20%. Light compensation points ranged from 100 to 207 &mu;mol PPFD m(-2)s(-1). No was relationship was found between 30-min nighttime NEE and tower-top air temperature. A weak relationship was found between hourly nighttime NEE and canopy air temperature using data averaged hourly over the entire sampling period (Q(10) = 1.79, R-2 = 0.17). The contribution of below-sensor storage was fairly constant from day to day. Our data indicate that this forest was a slight carbon source in 1998 (0.05 to -1.33 t C ha(-1)yr(-1)), a moderate sink in 1999 (-1.53 to -3.14 t C ha(-1)yr(-1)), and a strong sink in 2000 (-5.97 to -7.92 t C ha(-1)yr(-1)). This trend is interpreted as relating to the dissipation of warm-phase El Nino effects over the course of this study.","Loescher, HW

Crossover analysis using laser shots whose recorded waveforms contained more than 50% of the total returned energy within their lowest reflections show the elevations have a precision of better than 1 m. Comparison of the LVIS elevations with coincident in situ ground elevation data reveals that the measurements are within similar to1.5 m of each other on less than 3 slopes. All measurements are within similar to5 m of each other (on slopes of up to 30degrees). These are very encouraging results given that the forests of this region are some of the densest, most complex on Earth, and that snapping their sub-canopy topography are near-impossible using any other remote sensing technique. Given the similarity of the measurement processes of the LVIS and VCL systems, these results suggest that the topographic measurements made by the VCL will meet stated accuracy goals under the majority of measurement conditions.

"344","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","We compared the seed fate of two animal-dispersed, large-seeded timber species (Dipteryx panamensis [Fabaceae] and Carapa guianensis [Meliaceae]) in logged and fragmented forests with that for continuous forest in northeastern Costa Rica. For both species, we quantified rates of seed removal (an index of vertebrate predation) and the fate of dispersed seeds (those carried away from their original location that either germinated or were not subsequently removed within three months). We predicted that (1) fewer seeds would be dispersed by vertebrates in fragmented forest than in continuous forest due to low population abundances after hunting and/or loss of suitable habitat, and (2) seed predation rates would be higher in forest fragments than in continuous forest due to high abundance of small-bodied seed consumers. We compared three forest fragments currently managed for timber (140-350 ha) and a large reserve of continuous forest (La Selva, 1500 ha and connected to a national park). An exclusion experiment was performed (seeds placed in the open vs. seeds within semipermeable wire cages; 5 cm mesh size) to evaluate the relative roles of large and small animals on seed removal. Seed germination capacity did not differ among all four sites for both species. Removal of Dipteryx seeds was higher in forest fragments (50% removal within 10 days and related to the activity of small rodents) compared to La Selva (50% removal after 50 days). Also, more Dipteryx seeds were dispersed at La Selva than in fragmented forests. Contrary to our predictions, removal of Carapa seeds was equally high among all four sites, and there was a trend for more seeds of Carapa to be dispersed in fragments than in La Selva. Our results suggest that fragmentation effects on tree seed fate may be specific to species in question and contingent on the animal biota involved, and that management strategies for timber production based on regeneration from seed may differ between forest patches and extensive forests.","Guariguata, MR

"345","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Twenty common plant species were screened for emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) at a lowland tropical wet forest site in Costa Rica. Ten of the species examined emitted substantial quantities of isoprene. These species accounted for 35-50% of the total basal area of old-growth forest on the major edaphic site types, indicating that a high proportion of the canopy leaf area is a source of isoprene. A limited number of canopy-level BVOC flux measurements were also collected by relaxed eddy accumulation (REA). These measurements verify that the forest canopy in this region is indeed a significant source of isoprene. In addition, REA fluxes of methanol and especially acetone were also significant, exceeding model estimates and warranting future investigation at this site. Leaf monoterpene emissions were non-detectable or very low from the species surveyed, and ambient concentrations and REA fluxes likewise were very low. Although the isoprene emission rates reported here are largely consistent with phylogenetic relations found in other studies (at the family, genus, and species levels), two species in the family Mimosaceae, a group previously found to consist largely of non-isoprene emitters, emitted significant quantities of isoprene. One of these, Pentaclethra macroloba (Willd.) Kuntze, is by far the most abundant canopy tree species in the forests of this area, composing 30-40% of the total basal area. The other, Zygia longifolia (Humb. & Bonpl.) Britton & Rose is a common riparian species. Our results suggest that the source strength of BVOCs is important not only to tropical atmospheric chemistry, but also may be important in determining net ecosystem carbon exchange.

"346","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Large pieces of standing or fallen dead wood, known as coarse woody debris (CWD), play important roles in temperate forest carbon and nutrient cycles, and affect the abundance and distribution of many classes of organisms. CWD biomass and inputs are poorly documented in tropical rain forests (TRF), and the causes for their variation at landscape-scales in this biome have not been studied. We quantified standing and fallen CWD stocks and inputs in upland (non-swamp) old-growth TRF at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We used a network of 18 0.5 ha plots sited in three edaphic conditions to analyze soil nutrient effects on CWD stocks and inputs controlling for topography, and to examine topographic effects controlling for soil nutrients. The edaphic conditions were flat inceptisols. flat ultisols, and steep ultisols. Chemical analyses confirmed the existence of an almost three-fold gradient in total P and K in the upper I m of soil. We also annually censused all live woody stems greater than or equal to10 cm diameter above buttresses in each plot in September/October from 1997 to 2000 to obtain data on stand structure and dynamics.
Fallen CWD stocks averaged 46.3 Mg ha(-1) (22.3 Mg C ha(-1)), while standing CWD averaged 6.5 Mg ha(-1) (3.1 Mg C ha(-1)). There were no significant differences in volume or mass of standing or fallen CWD among edaphic conditions. Annual inputs of CWD averaged 4.9 Mg ha(-1) (2.4 Mg C ha(-1)). Tumover time of fallen CWD was ca. 9 year. Neither stocks nor inputs were correlated with stand structure (number of trees per plot, plot basal area, or plot estimated above-ground biomass). Potential differences in CWD stocks and inputs among sites with different edaphic conditions may have been obscured by a 10-fold variation in tree mortality among plots and a two-fold variation in mean CWD input among years. Analysis of sample variance showed that stocks of CWD were adequately sampled with the 18 0.5 ha plot design. but that inputs were measured with low precision.
At La Selva fallen and standing CWD stocks together equaled ca. 33% of estimated above-ground live woody biomass. Tropical rain forest CWD and its associated carbon are intermediate in pool size and turnover rate between fine litter and live trees. Our results show that scaling up TRF CWD estimates to larger spatial scales may be more constrained by the quality of data obtained over single landscapes than by variation due to zonal soil nutrient and topographic conditions. Both the magnitude and vagility of TRF CWD pools are likely to change with global climate change, but the overall direction of change is uncertain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The highest abundance of regenerating tree individuals was found in the understory of the mixed plantation (composed of Hieronyma alchorneoides + Vochysia ferruginea + Balizia elegans + Genipa americana) with 10, 156 individuals/ha, followed by pure plantation of H. alchorneoides with 7891, V ferruginea with 5703, B. elegans with 4219, G. americana with 1484, and the natural regeneration control with 703 individuals/ha. The highest mean number of species was found in the understory of the mixed plantation (11 species in 32 m(2)), followed by pure plantation of V ferruginea (8.0), H. alchorneoides (7.0), B. elegans (5.0), G. americana (3.0) and control (1.0).
Melastomataceae was the most abundant family in the understory of the mixed plantation and in the pure plantation of V ferruginea, while Rubiaceac was the most abundant under H. alchorneoides. In constrast, Piperaceae was the most abundant family under pure plantations of G. americana and B. elegans. In addition, species of primary forest of the region were found in the understory of the mixed plantation and under the pure plantations of H. alchorneoides and V. ferruginea. These are promising indicators for the use of these plantations as accelerators of natural forest succession in the region. Very few woody species were found in the control, natural regeneration plots. Factors that may impede the establishment of woody species in the control may be the lack of perches for seed dipersers and invasion by herbaceous vegetation which outcompetes the tree seedlings in their growth.

We also evaluated the potential seed dispersers of this tree relative to the role of the fruit-eating fish Brycon guatemalensis that previously was proposed to be an important disperser of F insipida seeds in this system. At La Selva, we recorded the fig-foraging activities of vertebrates at fruiting F insipida trees, surveyed for the presence or absence of F insipida along streams of different sizes, and determined the face of fig seedlings transplanted in different riparian habitats. In the greenhouse, we measured seed germination and seedling survival and growth under different light and soil pH conditions mimicking natural conditions. The findings provided evidence that (1) the tree occurs along the larger streams running through forest habitat and only along smaller streams with relatively high light availability; (2) bats (Artibeus spp.) and fish are the major dispersers of F insipida seeds; (3) the seedlings are subject to mortality not only from low light conditions but also from treefalls, frequent flooding, and bank erosion; and (4) high light levels and near neutral soil pH result in relatively better seed germination, faster growth, and higher survival rates of seedlings. Overall, our results suggest that this fig tree is dispersed mainly by bats and fish and is more establishment-limited than disperser-limited in its local distribution in the La Selva rain forest habitat.","Banack, SA

By 2002, its international membership included about 65 institutions, including four from Costa Rica. It had developed three Costa Rican field stations (La Selva, Las Cruces, and Palo Verde) with excellent facilities for teaching and research, and it was constructing a new Costa Rican office at the University of Costa Rica. Combinations of internal and external pressures influenced OTS to develop in new directions in the 1980s and 1990s. It became more diversified and more concerned with applied science in its traditional areas of graduate education and research facilitation. The Organization also evolved into new niches: more applied biology, professional education, environmental education and policy, conservation efforts, and an expanded geographic distribution to other Latin American countries. OTS was composed of changing combinations of people (Boards, members, staff) with evolving and competing priorities for limited financial resources. External environmental changes also shaped OTS's evolution. New problems of increased tropical deforestation, the emergence of the biodiversity ""crisis"" and conservation biology, global climate change, and calls for sustainable development affected OTS constituents and funding priorities of governments and foundations. Both internal and external pressures have in some cases demanded for OTS to improve its relationship with: Costa Rican biologists and their institutions, the Costa Rican government, and Costa Ricans living around the three OTS field stations.","Burlingame, LJ","Burlingame, LJ",NA,"439",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"472","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"JUN",NA,"J",NA,"2002",NA,NA,"12298277",NA,NA,"0034-7744","REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL",NA,"Evolution of the organization for tropical studies","WOS:000177384400006","50",NA,NA,349

The relationship between canopy structure and throughfall were examined to identify key sources of spatial variation. Geostatistical analyses were also used to examine the spatial variation in throughfall, spatial autocorrelation and to determine minimum distances for independence of collectors. Throughfall volume was collected from 56 ground-based (funnel-style) collectors. Throughfall was collected for 26 separate precipitation events during July and August 1998. Per cent cover, distance to nearest tree, distance to nearest leaf were also estimated for each collection point. A weak relationship was found with per cent cover (r(2) = 0.11). No relationship was found between throughfall and distance to the nearest leaf above the collector. Estimated interception was 1.88 mm (r(2) = 0.94) with increased variance as bulk precipitation increased. A range distance of 45 m was estimated from variograms, strongly suggesting that large tree canopies and gaps are the source of much of the spatial variance in throughfall volume. Interception was reduced by 19% if only spatially independent collectors were used.","Loescher, HW

We transplanted seedlings of the canopy tree species, Diptenyx panamensis, Virola koschnyii, and Brosimum alicastrum into second-growth forest and native tree plantations at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We assessed seedling survival, growth, and seedling light environments bimonthly for 14 months. Plants were harvested at the end of the study to assess leaf area, total biomass. biomass partitioning and root growth. Survivorship of all species exceeded 60% across all microsites, although both D. panamensis and B. alicastrum had lower probabilities of survival in the darkest microsites. All species showed a strong positive relationship between light availability and growth, increasing in total biomass as light increased. However, the strength of the growth response differed among species causing a change in the rank order of species growth rates as light availability increased. Although D. panamensis showed the lowest growth rates in the darkest microsites, a strong response to increasing light led to a cross-over in performance, such that D. panamensis had the highest growth rate at the highest light levels studied. These data suggest that resource gradient partitioning could occur even in low light environments (0.2-6.5%). Given the limited range of light regimes sampled (i.e., non-gap microsites), our data demonstrate that growth of tropical tree seedlings beneath closed canopies is highly sensitive to light availability and that shade-tolerant species vary in these responses. Our results show that understory light heterogeneity, in the absence of canopy gaps, can significantly affect recruitment processes for shade-tolerant tree species.","Montgomery, RA

"352","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In some leaf-cutting ant species, minim workers ride on the fragments of leaves as they are carried back to the nest from the cutting site. There is convincing evidence that these ""hitchhikers"" can protect the leaf carriers from attack by phorid (Diptera: Phoridae) parasitoids, but we consider the possibility of other functions for the hitchhiking behavior. It has been hypothesized that the hitchhikers (1) feed on leaf sap from the edges of the cut leaves; (2) ride back to the nest to save energy; (3) get caught on the fragments as they are cut, and hitchhike because they cannot (or will not) get off; and (4) begin the process of preparing the leaf to enter the fungal gardens in the nest, perhaps by removing microbial contaminants. We observed hitchhikers of Atra cephalotes in 14 nests at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. There was no difference in the proportion of leaf carriers with hitchhikers between day and night. Because the nests we observed were largely nocturnal, more than 90 percent of the hitchhiking occurred at night. The phorid parasitoids are usually considered to be diurnal, so the preponderance of nocturnal hitchhiking suggests other functions in addition to parasitoid defense. Hitchhikers spent more time in the defensive head-up posture during the day, but spent more time in the head-down posture at night. The head-down posture may indicate cleaning or other leaf preparation. The hitchhikers were never observed feeding on sap. Hitchhikers frequently got onto and off of the fragments, and so they were not ""marooned."" Few hitchhikers rode all the way back to the nest and were often moving on the leaf fragment; these observations make the energy conservation hypothesis less likely, although we cannot reject it. We conclude that parasitoid defense is an important function of hitchhiking but also that there are probably other functions when parasitoids are absent. Based on available data, the most likely possibility is preparation of the leaf fragment before it enters the nest.","Linksvayer, TA

"353","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Species richness is an important characteristic of ecological communities, but it is difficult to quantify. We report here a thorough inventory of a tropical rain forest ant fauna and use it to evaluate species richness estimators. The study was carried out in similar to1500 ha of lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Diverse methods were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples, Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal, and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the area under the fitted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the Michaelis-Menten equation fit to the species accumulation curve, and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots. The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable in sample-based rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12% of the total) were still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory. The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by ""edge effects"": ""methodological edge species"" (possibly abundant at the site but difficult to sample because of their microhabitat), and ""geographic edge species,"" known to be common in habitats or regions outside of La Selva. Rarity of 31 species remained unexplained. Most of the 51 rare species were known from additional collections outside of La Selva, either in other parts of Costa Rica or in other countries. Only six species were ""global uniques,"" known to date from only one sample on Earth. The study demonstrates that patterns of species occurrence early in an inventory may be inadequate to estimate species richness, but that relatively complete inventories of species-rich arthropod communities are possible if multiple sampling methods and extensive effort are applied.","Longino, JT

"354","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Chemical data from several hundred surface water and groundwater samples collected mainly during baseflow over 4.5 years were used to detect and quantify the natural interbasin transfer of deep groundwater into watersheds at La Selva Biological Station, a research site in the lowland rainforest of Costa Rica. Most of the variability in major ion concentrations at La Selva can be explained by mixing of two chemically and hydrologically distinct waters: high-solute bedrock groundwater, and low from hillslope soils within the study watersheds. Several lines of evidence indicate that high-solute solute local water draining. bedrock groundwater represents subsurface interbasin transfer into the study site.
The fraction of water due to interbasin transfer (f(water)) ranged from zero to about 0.49 for major streams at La Selva; f(water) values were even higher (up to 0.84) for small riparian seeps and shallow groundwater near the Salto stream. The relative contribution of major ions by interbasin transfer was even more significant than of water itself. f(water) values of 0.49 and 0.84 correspond to f(Cl) values of 0.92 and 0.99, respectively (f(Cl) the fraction of dissolved chloride in a water sample that is due to interbasin transfer, is approximately equal to the fraction of all major ions contributed to the sample by interbasin transfer, given the observed linear correlation between Cl and other major ions). f(water) and f(Cl) of streams and riparian seeps varied on both long (monthly/seasonal) and short (storm event) time scales, in each case decreasing as conditions at La Selva became wetter. The high f(water) values found in riparian groundwater and seeps indicate that local water and bedrock groundwater derived from interbasin transfer mix in the shallow subsurface at La Selva, not just in stream channels. With f(water) values up to 0.84, it appears that some areas of riparian wetland may be maintained largely by interbasin transfer.
This large interbasin transfer significantly affects both terrestrial (e.g. wetland) and aquatic ecosystems. Results suggest the importance of a regional approach to land use planning in this and similar environments. Complete protection of lowland streams, wetlands, and ecosystems in this hydrogeologic setting requires protection of a deep interbasin groundwater system whose precise volume, boundaries, and recharge areas are presently unknown.

Additionally, estimation of forest structural attributes, such as aboveground biomass (AGBM), is an important step in identifying the amount of carbon in terrestrial vegetation pools and is central to global carbon cycle studies. Although current remote sensing techniques recover such tropical forest structure poorly, new large-footprint lidar instruments show great promise. As part of a prelaunch validation plan for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission, the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS), a large-footprint airborne scanning lidar, was flown over the La Selva Biological Station, a tropical wet forest site in Costa Rica. The primary objective of this study was to test the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to recover forest structural characteristics across a spectrum of land cover types from pasture to secondary and primary tropical forests. LVIS metrics were able to predict field-derived quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD), basal area, and AGBM with R 2 values of up to .93,.72, and .93, respectively. These relationships were significant and nonasymptotic through the entire range of conditions sampled at the La Selva.

Such variation occurs naturally in streams at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica due to spatially variable inputs of geothermally modified groundwater. We examined effects of this gradient on detrital food web components at 16 stream sites. The Michaelis-Menten model provided a good fit of the relationship between soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and leaf decay rate, fungal biomass, and invertebrate biomass, indicating that these variables were controlled by P concentration and that half-saturation constants were relatively low (7-13 mug L-1 SRP). In a subsequent short-term (3 week) whole-stream P enrichment study, we found no effect of P addition on leaf decay rate or on biomass or density of invertebrates. However, laboratory tests of P, N, and Ca concentrations on mass loss of leaves showed detectable stimulation by both N and P after 3 weeks. A fourth study assessed the relative contribution of invertebrate consumption versus P concentration in determining decay rates among streams. The majority of variation was due to P concentration (71%), compared to effects of invertebrates (3%) or invertebrate x P interactions (14%). Overall, we found that a landscape-scale natural gradient in P concentration influenced decay rates of organic matter and biomass of consumers, providing evidence that benthic detrital food webs can be limited from the bottom up by nutrients. Microbial processes appeared to be must important in driving differences in organic matter decay among sites, but invertebrates also contributed to elevated decay rates at high-P sites.","Rosemond, AD

"362","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In food webs based on primary production, biomass of organisms within trophic levels can be simultaneously controlled by resources (bottom-up) and consumers (top-down). In contrast, very little is known about top-down and bottom-up control in detritus-based food webs. Here, we tested whether exclusion of macroconsumers (fishes and shrimps) and/or phosphorus (P) addition affected insect detritivore biomass and decay rate and quality of leaf detritus in a tropical stream. Four treatments were established in a third-order stream in Costa Rica: (1) macroconsumers present, ambient P; (2) macroconsumers excluded, ambient P; (3) macroconsumers present, P added; (4) macroconsumers excluded, P added. Biomass of insect larvae inhabiting leaf packs and mass loss of leaves were measured after 7 and 10 d in situ. After 10 d, biomass and density of insect larvae increased as a result of both P addition and exclusion of macroconsumers. Chironomids (Diptera, Chironominae) were the dominant detritivores in leaf packs, comprising 51-80% of total invertebrate biomass and were responsible for the observed treatment effects. Mass loss rates of leaf packs were accelerated by the presence of macroconsumers but not by P addition. Positive effects of P on insects presumably occurred through increased microbial carbon relative to leaf carbon. However, percentage nitrogen (N), C:N, and fungal biomass of leaves were not affected by either experimental treatment. Laboratory growth studies corroborated positive effects of P on chironomids: growth rates were higher in high-P treatments (high-P stream water and low-P stream water with P added) vs. low-P stream water. However, no differences in the in situ growth rates were observed between a high-and a low-P stream.
The relative importance of top-down and bottom-up effects was evaluated using several indices. Loss rates of organic matter were affected more by top-down effects of macroconsumers than by bottom-up effects of P. Macroconsumers had negative effects on two trophic levels, contrary to food-web theory predicting alternating negative and positive effects. Positive bottom-up effects of P on insect biomass were greater than negative top-down effects of macroconsumers. In addition, P effects on invertebrates were similar in direction but greater in magnitude than previously published effects of nutrients on consumers in food webs based on primary producers. These results suggest that the impacts of nutrient enrichment on detritivores may be as great or greater than those previously observed on herbivores.","Rosemond, AD

I used a logistic regression to determine which natural-history characteristics were most important in predicting a list of threatened birds known to occur in Nicaragua. The best model included five macroecological variables (body weight, habitat specificity, trophic group, forest preference, and biogeography within Nicaragua). I used this model to generate predicted probabilities of extinction for all forest birds in Nicaragua. The predicted probability of extinction from the best model ranked 63% of the extinction-prone birds from La Selva, Costa Rica, and 59% of the extinction-prone birds from Barro Colorado, Panama, in the first quartile of all forest birds recorded in Nicaragua. This method provides a first-order approximation of which species deserve global and national priorities for conservation. The central and Atlantic regions of Nicaragua deserve high priority for conservation at a global scale, whereas the Atlantic region deserves the highest priority for conservation at a national scale. The Nicaraguan Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment has done an adequate job of identifying areas for conservation based on the proportion of decreed nature reserves in each biogeographic region and the distribution of forest birds with a high predicted probability of extinction.

Particularly poorly documented are the nature and time scale of upward height growth during regeneration by the tree species in these communities. In this study, we assessed long-term height growth through ontogeny For a diverse group of canopy and emergent tree species in a lowland neotropical rain forest (the La Selva Biological Station, northeastern Costa Rica). Species were evaluated based on annual height measurements of large samples of individuals in all postseedling size classes, over a 16-yr period (> 11000 increments). The study species were seven nonpioneers (Minquartia guianensis. Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Simarouba amara, Dipteryx panamensis, Balizia elegans, and Hyeronima alchorneoides) and two pioneers (Cecropia obtusifolia and Cecropia insignis). For each species, inherent height growth capacity was estimated as the mean of the five largest annual height increments (from different individuals) in each juvenile size class (from 50 cm tall to 20 cm in diameter). All species showed marked ontogenetic increases in this measure of height growth potential. At all sizes, there were highly significant differences among species in height growth potential. The two Cecropia species consistently showed the highest observed maximum height increments as smaller juveniles (less than or equal to4 cm in diameter). Among the nonpioneers, Simarouba had the highest growth potential across all juvenile sizes. For all species, mean annual height increments in all juvenile size classes were very much lower than the species' potential growth rates and reflected the impacts of frequent periods of zero growth and major height losses from physical damage. Because of the same factors, maximum net height increments declined over increasing measurement intervals (1-15-yr periods). With only one exception (Simarouba amara saplings less than or equal to1 cm in diameter that survived 10 yr), the annual height growth increments of these species showed no significant temporal autocorrelation. For the seven nonpioneer species, we estimated the minimum time required to grow from 50 cm tall saplings to 10 cm diameter trees, based on their greatest net height increments over increasing intervals. Estimated passage times increased from 7-33 yr, when based on maximum 5-yr height increments, to 37-83 yr, when based on maximum net height growth over 15 yr for the six longest studied (nonpioneer) species. Given the erratic height growth trajectories found for these juvenile trees in this 16-yr study, it is clear that much longer term observation is required. Still unknown are the actual growth trajectories that characterize successful regeneration in each of our focal species, how much time successful trees spend as suppressed juveniles, and the number of times they experience and recover from major physical damage.","Clark, DA

We recorded 249 species from 39 families, including 196 species captured in mist nets (10,019 captures) and 215 recorded during point counts (15,577 observations), which represents similar to 78% of the terrestrial avifauna known from La Selva (excluding accidentals and birds characteristic of aquatic or aerial habitats).

"369","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","One of the most intriguing and complex characteristics of reproductive phenology in tropical forests is high diversity within and among forests. To understand such diversity, Newstrom et al. provided a systematic framework for the classification of tropical flowering phenology. They adopted frequency and regularity as criteria with priority, and classified plants in La Selva, Costa Rica, where most plants reproduced more than once a year irregularly. Many other studies have demonstrated annual cycles corresponding to rainfall patterns at the community level in Neotropical forests, including La Selva. On the other hand, supraannual flowering synchronized among various plant species, called general flowering, is known from aseasonal lowland dipterocarp forests in Southeast Asia. Within both forests, a wide spectrum of flowering patterns is found. This range of patterns suggests the great potential of tropical phenological studies to explore the selective pressures on phenology. Various abiotic and biotic factors can be selective agents. The shared pollinators hypothesis suggests that plant species sharing pollinators segregate flowering temporarily to minimize interspecific overlap in flowering times and thus minimize ineffective pollination or competition for pollinators, indicating strong phylogenetic constraints in timing and variation of flowering. Comparison of phenology within and among forests may help our understanding of phenological diversity. Attempts are now being made to develop a common language to communicate concepts and render interpretations of data more compatible among investigators and to create a network to promote comparative studies.","Sakai, S","Sakai, S",NA,"77",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/PL00012018",NA,"86","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"APR",NA,"J",NA,"2001",NA,"Sakai, Shoko/0000-0002-4267-8405",NA,NA,NA,"1438-3896","POPULATION ECOLOGY",NA,"Phenological diversity in tropical forests","WOS:000169145300010","43",NA,NA,369

Bird-dispersed species were the most common species (59%), followed by mammal-dispersed species (26%), Primates were less important than bats and civets in seed dispersal, Fifteen per cent of the species had no apparent adaptation for abiotic dispersal (mechanically dispersed) except one wind-dispersed species.

This is the highest alpha-diversity so far reported for foliicolous lichens on individual leaves and invites for comparison with tree diversity in tropical rain forests. Due to the high proportion of species represented by a single thallus, the taxonomic diversity of lichens on individual leaves (or trees in selected plots) cannot be self-supporting, but reflects a high degree of dispersion or entropy within the community of which the individual leaf (or selected plot) is part. Diversity is therefore fractal, showing similar patterns at different scales, each part of a given community reflecting the entire community.

"373","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","This report describes the results of nonvolant mammal inventory fieldwork at Paracou, a lowland rainforest locality in northern French Guiana, and concludes the faunal analysis introduced by our previous monograph on the bats of Paracou (Simmons and Voss, 1998). Working within a 3-km radius over the course of 202 sampling dates from 1991 to 1994, we recorded a total of 64 nonvolant species by conventional trapping, arboreal platform trapping, pitfall trapping, diurnal and nocturnal hunting, and interviews with local residents. Included in this total species count are 12 marsupials, 9 xenarthrans, 6 primates, 10 carnivores, 5 ungulates, and 22 rodents.
Systematic research with nonvolant mammal specimens collected as voucher material resulted in the discovery of new taxa, documented range extensions of previously described species, and helped resolve many longstanding taxonomic problems: (1) Gracilinanus emiliae (Thomas), herein reported for the first time from French Guiana, is redescribed and its known geographic distribution documented; based on examination of type material and original descriptions, G. longicaudus Hershkovitz is considered a junior synonym of G. emiliae, but Marmosa agricolai Moojen is not. (2) A new genus is proposed for Gracilinanus kalinowskii Hershkovitz, a taxon previously known only from eastern Peru, in recognition of its trenchant morphological differences from all other known didelphimorph marsupials. (3) Marmosops parvidens (Tate) and M. pinheiroi (Pine), the latter originally described as a subspecies of the former, are distinct species that occur sympatrically at Paracou; based on examination of type material, other taxa hitherto synonymized with M. parvidens are also judged to be valid species, including M. juninensis (Tate) and M. bishopi (Pine). (4) Monodelphis brevicaudata (Erxleben), M. glirina (Wagner), and M. palliolata (Osgood) are all distinct species diagnosable by unique combinations of morphological traits; based on examined specimens, M. brevicaudata (with type locality emended herein as Kartabo, Guyana) appears to be endemic to the Guiana subregion of Amazonia and to include both bicolored and tricolored phenotypes; a neotype from Cayenne, French Guiana, is designated to fix the application of Viverra touan Shaw as the oldest available name for the tricolored form. (5) Saguinus midas (Linnaeus) and S. niger (E. Geoffroy), currently treated as synonyms or conspecific races, are unambiguously diagnosable species that do not appear to be sister taxa; a neotype is designated to conserve current usage of niger E. Geoffroy for the black-handed tamarin of southeastern Amazonia. (6) Two new small species of Neacomys are described from material collected at Paracou; their diagnostic attributes are documented by detailed comparisons with other like-sized con geners from northern South America. (7) Nectomys melanius Thomas is recognized as a species distinct from N. squamipes (Brants) and N. palmipes J. A. Alien and Chapman; however, N. parvipes Fetter is not a valid taxon and is herein synonymized with N. melanius. (8) The diagnostic characters of Neusticomys oyapocki (Fetter and Dubost), a species previously known only from the holotype, are reevaluated and illustrated from freshly collected material. (9) Oecomys auyantepui Tate and O. paricola (Thomas), previously treated as synonyms, are valid species distinguished by consistent cranial differences and occupy allopatric ranges north and south of the Amazon, respectively. (10) A critical examination of small Oecomys specimens from Paracou and other Guianan localities supports the conclusions of other investigators that O. rutilus Anthony and O. bicolor (Tomes) are unambiguously diagnosable species. (11) Oligoryzomys fulvescens (Saussure) and O.. microtis (J. A. Alien), currently regarded as valid allopatric species occurring north and south of the Amazon, respectively, are difficult to diagnose unambiguously and may be conspecific; new information is provided about the hitherto ambiguous type locality of the latter taxon. (12) Rhipidomys nitela Thomas is reported from French Guiana for the first time and its previously unpublished diagnostic differences from other congeners are tabulated and discussed.
(13) A lectotype is designated for Coendou melanurus (Wagner), and the species is redescribed based on all known specimens in North American and European museums; diagnostic differences between this: species and C. insidiosus (Olfers) are illustrated for the first time. (14) A red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta) is designated as the neotype of Mus aguti Linnaeus to preserve current usage of Dasyprocta prymnolopha (Wagler) for the black-rumped agouti. (15) The diagnostic differences between red and green acouchies (Myoprocta) are discussed and a neotype is designated for Cavia acouchy Erxleben to fix the application of that name to the red species; other nominal taxa of Myoprocta are identified as red or green acouchies based on examination of type material and original descriptions. (16) The diagnostic morphological traits of Proechimys cuvieri Fetter and P. guyannensis (E. Geoffroy) are reevaluated and discussed based on character variation in topotypical (French Guianan) material.
Analyses of our sampling results indicate that distinct sets of nonvolant species are effectively sampled by different inventory methods, and that increased sampling effort with any method generally results in more species. Although the rate of discovery of new species always decreases with increasing sample size, none of our graphs of species accumulation indicate that an asymptotic value was reached with any method. Instead, nonparametric statistical extrapolations suggest that the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna consists of somewhere between 69 and 74 species; by implication, our nonvolant inventory is about 86-93% complete. Most missing species are probably marsupials and rodents, but one or two expected primate species might have been locally extirpated by hunters prior to our fieldwork.
In terms of higher taxonomic composition, the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna is typical of those found throughout the humid Neotropical lowlands. However, a quantitative analysis of nonvolant faunal similarity at the species level among 12 exemplar rainforest inventories first clusters the Paracou list with others from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, next with lists from elsewhere in Amazonia, and lastly with Central American lists. Pairwise similarity values likewise show an obvious positive correlation between faunal resemblance and geographic proximity within the Neotropical rainforest biome. At least 24 species (38%) of the Paracou nonvolant fauna are Amazonian endemics, but 18 (28%) are essentially pan-Neotropical in distribution; the remaining 22 species exhibit a variety of distributional patterns that suggest past connections among different sets of currently disjunct rainforested regions.
Species richness comparisons among nonvolant faunal inventories are complicated by a variety of familiar problems including inconsistent methodology, presence or absence of certain key habitats, and uneven sampling effort. A conservative interpretation of sampling results from La Selva (Costa Rica), Paracou, and Manu (Peru), however, suggests progressive increases in richness of about 23% from Central America to the Guianas, and of about the same amount from the Guianas to western Amazonia; over the entire gradient (Central America to western Amazonia), the net increase in observed richness is at least 50%. Whereas rodents are consistently the most diverse clade in all well-sampled nonvolant faunas, rankings of other orders by relative richness exhibit considerable site-to-site variation, at least some of which appears to reflect real geographic differences in taxonomic diversity rather than sampling artifacts.
Nonvolant rainforest mammals are hard to classify into trophic guilds due to behavioral plasticity and incomplete knowledge of relevant natural history. Preliminary guild comparisons among three exemplar faunas, however, suggest that the Paracou nonvolant community is substantially less diverse in arboreal frugivores and more diverse in terrestrial animalivores than are nonvolant communities at some Central American and western Amazonian sites. Subsistence and recreational hunting has clearly affected local populations of some nonvolant mammals at Paracou; whereas popular game species (e.g., large primates) were seldom sighted, density compensation may explain high local densities of certain other taxa (e.g., Potus flavus and Cuniculus paca). Patterns of differential habitat use between closely related nonvolant species at Paracou were mostly observed within the terrestrial granivore/frugivore guild.
Combining these results with those previously reported for the sympatric bat fauna, we recorded a total of 142 mammalian species at Paracou. By statistical extrapolation from our sampling data, the entire local community perhaps contains 155-168 species; because the known French Guianan rainforest mammal fauna contains at least 167 species for which suitable habitat is present in our study area, such estimates are plausible. By implication, our inventory is perhaps 85-92% complete overall.
A synthesis of biogeographic information analyzed in this monograph and by Simmons and Voss (1998) suggests that faunal turnover with increasing geographic distance is much higher for nonvolant mammals than for bats, a necessary consequence of observed group differences in endemicity: whereas many nonvolant rainforest mammals have geographic ranges bounded by obvious topographic or habitat discontinuities (e.g., large rivers, xeromorphic vegetation), most rainforest bats are geographically widespread. Not surprisingly, most of the taxa that usefully define a Guianan center of mammalian endemism are nonvolant species. The geographic limits of Guianan endemism appear to be remarkably similar for mammals, birds, snakes, lizards, and trees, suggesting a common pattern of biotic differentiation.
Overall, the Paracou mammal fauna conforms broadly with previous generalizations about community-wide patterns of diel activity and substrate use by Neotropical rainforest mammals, but appears to diverge significantly from conventional views about trophic structure. Whereas there are many more species of secondary consumers than primary consumers at Paracou, primary consumers appear to outnumber secondary consumers by an equally large margin at some western Amazonian inventory sites. Sampling artifacts perhaps explain some of the community differences observed in such comparisons, but real geographic variation in trophic structure is also apparent.","Voss, RS

"374","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","A better understanding of the reasons for variation in tropical rain forest (TRF) structure is important for quantifying global above-ground biomass (AGBM). We used three data sets to estimate stem number, basal area, and AGBM over a 600-ha old-growth TRF landscape (La Selva, N.E. Costa Rica). We analyzed the effects of soil type, slope angle, topographic position, and different sample designs and measurement techniques on these estimates. All three data sets were for woody stems greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter. Estimated AGBM was determined from stand-level measurements using Brown's (Brown, 1997) allometric equation for Tropical Wet: Forest trees. One data set was from three subjectively-sited 4-ha plots (the 'OTS plots'), another was based on 1170 0.01 ha plots spaced on a regular grid (the 'Vegetation map plots'), and the third was from 18 0.5 ha plots (the 'Carbono plots') sited to provide unbiased samples of three edaphic conditions: hat inceptisol old alluvial terraces; Rat ultisol hill-tops; and steep ultisol slopes. Basal area, estimated AGBM and the contributions of major life forms were similar among studies, in spite of the differences in sampling design and measurement techniques. Although the Carbono plots on Rat inceptisols had significantly larger and fewer trees than those on ultisols, AGBM did not vary over the relatively small edaphic gradient in upland areas at La Selva. On residual soils, the largest trees were on the flattest topographic positions. Slope angle per se was not correlated with basal area or AGBM within the residual soils. Errors introduced by palm and liana lift: forms, as well as hollow trees, did not significantly affect AGBM estimates. In contrast, the methods used to measure buttressed trees had a large impact. Plot sizes of 0.35-0.5 ha were sufficient to achieve coefficients of variation of <12% for basal area with only six replicates in a given edaphic type. AGBM estimates ranged from 161 to 186 Mg/ha. These low values appear to be mainly due to the Tropical Wet Forest allometry equation used. This in turn may be indicative of a real and substantially lower ratio of biomass/basal area in Tropical Wet Forest than in Tropical Moist, as previously noted by Brown (1996).
Our results indicate that for upland TRF landscapes with levels of environmental variation similar to La Selva, AGBM will be relatively insensitive to soil type and topography. However, because topography and soil type had much stronger effects on stem size, stand density, and spatial heterogeneity of sterns, stand dynamics may be more sensitive than AGBM to this range of conditions. We recommend that future studies of landscape-scale forest structure employ stratified sampling designs across major environmental gradients. Unbiased sampling with replication, combined with consistent and well-documented measurement techniques, will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the magnitude of and reasons for variation in forest structure and AGBM within TRF landscapes.

"376","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","We evaluated seed removal by terrestrial mammals and the fate of removed, threaded seeds (as a measure of dispersal) in two neighboring tropical rain forest sites in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. Both sites have been selectively logged but differ in their degree of protection from human intrusion and habitat connectivity: La Selva is protected from hunting and connected to a national park, whereas Tirimbina remains unprotected and is not connected to a park. The two study sites are similar in logging intensity, elevation, and canopy tree structure and composition. We predicted that rates of seed removal and seed dispersal would be higher at the connected and protected site. For seven tree species (six of which are timber species), we determined that patterns of seed removal under an exclusion experiment (semipermeable cages vs. uncaged) varied both within species across sites and within sites across species, suggesting site differences in abundance, degree of animal activity, or presence of particular mammal seed consumers. Rates of seed removal and dispersal were largely species-specific. Most of the study species showed neither site nor treatment effect, whereas others had disproportionately higher removal rates at La Selva. For all species combined (covering a 6-month period due to phenological differences among the study species; n = 920 seeds per site), twice as many removed seeds were dispersed at La Selva (5.3%) than at Tirimbina (2.2%). Only one timber species, Pentaclethra macroloba, did not appear sensitive to site differences in rates of seed removal, most likely because its seeds are toxic to animals. Two timber species, Carapa nicaraguensis and Lecythis ampla, whose seeds are consumed by large scatterhoarding rodents, had 2.5% and 13%, respectively, of their removed seeds dispersed at La Selva, whereas no seeds were dispersed at Tirimbina. In northeastern Costa Rica, where forest cover is fragmented and selective logging is currently underway, the biological sustainability of timber species dispersed by terrestrial mammals may be more likely in sites protected from hunting and/or adjacent to protected areas than in forested patches subjected to hunting.","Guariguata, MR

"378","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","We report measurements of the N-15 and O-18 signature of N2O emitted from tropical rain forest soils at the La Selva Biological station in Costa Rica and in the Fazenda Vitoria in the State of Para, Brazil. The delta(15)N values ranged from -34 to 2 parts per thousand with respect to atmospheric N-2, while delta(18)O values had a smaller range, from -4 to 18 parts per thousand with respect to atmospheric O-2. We attribute these large variations to differences in microbial production, consumption, and transport of N2O. In general the delta(15)N of N2O emissions from an Oxisol soil in Brazil were consistently enriched by similar to 20 parts per thousand in N-15 compared to those from Ultisol and Inceptisol soils in Costa Rica. Denitrification is the most likely source of N2O in both locations during the rainy season, and the N-15 of nitrate was similar in both locations. We attribute the overall variability in emitted N-15 to differences in the ratio of N2O:N-2 escaping from the soil to the atmosphere, with a larger fraction of the N2O reduced to N-2 at the Brazilian sites. We found light delta(15)N-N2O values associated with high N2O emissions in a fertilized agricultural site in Costa Rica and in a ""hot spot"" of high emissions in the forest site in Brazil. This result suggests that the increase of substrate availability might increase the fractionation associated with N2O production. Overall, the Brazilian Oxisol soils had the most enriched delta(15)N-N2O emissions yet measured from soils. if these are more representative of tropical soil emissions than the Costa Rica emissions, then the globally averaged delta(15)N-N2O tropical rain forest soil source is more enriched than previously estimated. The large variations in isotopic signature for N2O emissions demonstrate the potential utility of stable isotopes as tools for understanding the processes of N2O production and consumption in soils.","Perez, T

We studied the effect of the absence or presence of external organic refuse on the abundance of fine roots and seed bank composition in the superficial horizons of ant nests. We sampled soils from ant nests or dumps and adjacent areas of 15 adult nests of A. cephalotes at La Selva (LS), Costa Rice, and of 15 of A. colombica nests on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Soils from A. cephalotes nests did nor differ from adjacent soils in abundance of fine-root and seed diversity. In contrast, organic refuse from A. colombica nests was less diverse in seed composition (due to the great abundance of Miconia argentea) and had a greater abundance of fine roots than adjacent areas. Thus the external location of the ant-nest organic refuse is potentially important in determining the different types of plant recolonization in abandoned or dead ant nests. The relative abundance of these Atta species may influence the structure and/or composition of tropical forests.","Farji-Brener, AG

Tree height, age, stem diameter at breast height, and crown diameter were analyzed with regression techniques.

Results were consistent with competition-density patterns observed in temperate forest trees. The ratio between the crown diameter and stem diameter in C. alliodora was not significantly related to density, although this ratio varied directly with tree age. These results suggest that the merchantable yield of C. alliodora in the low-elevation moist tropics of Atlantic Costa Rica may be increased via stand-density management.

In the first year, there was no significant difference in the mean aboveground understory biomass between the monocultures of C. alliodora (7975 kg/ha) and the polycultures of trees and monocots (5427 kg/ha). After 5 years, the understory biomass in the monocultures increased (16,918 kg/ha), while in the polycultures it decreased (116 kg/ha). In contrast to the first year, therefore, by the fifth year the understory biomass differed significantly between the two types of plantations (p = 0.005, R-2 = 0.78, LSD = 5200 kg).
In the first year, 109 plant species were present in the understory of the C. alliodora monocultures and polycultures. The dominant species in both the monocultures and polycultures was the monocot Tripogandra serrulata; Panicum polygonatum was ranked second. After 5 years, 20 species representing 15 families were present in the monocultures. The dominant species was Paspalum conjugatum, followed by Tripogandra serrulata. Only two new species were recruited, and both were woody shrubs: Nectandra membranacea and Vernonia patens.","Hummel, S","Hummel, S",NA,"159",NA,NA,NA,"10.1023/A:1006608905535",NA,"170","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAR",NA,"J",NA,"2000",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0169-4286","NEW FORESTS",NA,"Understory development in young Cordia alliodora plantations","WOS:000086665500003","19",NA,NA,382
"383","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","In spite of the growing importance of neotropical secondary forests as sources of timber and environmental services, the baseline information needed to develop silvicultural options is still limited. In this paper I describe interspecific patterns of seed longevity in the soil, germination, and survival and growth of transplanted seedlings under closed canopy of nine tree species that are common in secondary forest stands in wet, lowland Costa Rica and most of which are timber species in the region: Cordia alliodora, Hampea appendiculata, Jacaranda copaia, Laetia procera, Rollinia microsepala, Simarouba amara, Stryphnodendron microstachyum, Trichospermum grewiifolium, and Vochysia ferruginea, Many of these species also occur throughout the lowland neotropics. Experiments were carried out in three replicate secondary-forest stands (20-30 yr old after pasture abandonment) located at La Selva Biological Station in northeastern Costa Rica. Longevity of experimental seed cohorts differed markedly among species, from <3 mo (Cordia, Hampea, Simarouba, Vochysia), to >1 yr (Stryphnodendron). Similarly, germination of recently dispersed seeds in the understory ranged from 0% in Laetin to >75% in Cordia and Vochysia. In contrast, seedling survival was uniformly low (<10% survival one year after transplanting except for Stryphnodendron, which showed similar to 20% survival).
The implications of these findings for the management of secondary forest stands for timber production are varied and depend on the species of interest. First, all study species appear to require nearly complete canopy opening to regenerate as they show limited capacity either to germinate or to survive as seedlings in the understory. Second, some species that can germinate at high levels in the shade can be managed at the seedling stage by opening up the canopy a few months after germination (e.g., Cordia, Simarouba, Vochysia). Third, species that show little or no germination under closed canopy (e.g., Jacaranda, Laetin, Rollinia) will need canopy removal simply to germinate in adequate amounts. Due to rapid declines in seed viability and seedling survivorship, however, any canopy manipulation must be performed not beyond 6 mo in order to guarantee adequate levels of soil-stored seeds or seedlings for future stand development. Site-preparation techniques may need implementation, given the potential of competing vegetation to interfere with seedlings after canopy opening, as suggested by the high abundance of herbs and shrubs present in the soil seed bank in the study stands. This ecological scenario is likely to occur in secondary stands elsewhere in the region as secondary stands are usually located within agricultural land. Finally, the results of this study suggest that ecological classifications of trees solely based on light preferences for stem growth may fail to account for important differences among species in their regeneration mode. This is of particular importance for refining silvicultural guidelines in neotropical secondary forests.","Guariguata, MR","Guariguata, MR",NA,"145",NA,NA,NA,"10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0145:SASEOT]2.0.CO;2",NA,"154","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"FEB",NA,"J",NA,"2000",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1051-0761","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS",NA,"Seed and seedling ecology of tree species in neotropical secondary

Twenty compounds belonging to four different chemical substance classes were tested, both in the laboratory and in the field. In the laboratory, the bats (Glossophaga soricina) approached odour sources spontaneously and without preceding experience. Without ever receiving any reward they preferred the scent of a sulphur-containing compound, dimethyl disulphide, to several other odour components emitted by bat-pollinated flowers, and to scentless controls. In the field, at La Selva station in the tropical lowland rain forest of Costa Rica, G. commissarisi were attracted by two sulphur-containing compounds, dimethyl disulphide and 2,4-dithiapentane, to visit artificial flowers filled with sugar water. Thus, in nectarivorous bats the sense of smell obviously plays an important role in searching for and localising food sources, and even single components of the scent bouquets of bat-pollinated flowers are attractive.

The number of seed produced per inflorescence of C. ghiesbreghtiana was limited substantially by the loss of female flowers to floral herbivores. Much variation in the number of seed produced per inflorescence of C. ghiesbreghtiana was due to losses of developing fruits to predators. Together these phenomena illustrate the influential role of natural enemies in the reproductive success of this plant. Seed-set efficiency (number of seeds/number of female flowers) was highly variable in this species, and such high levels of variation appear to be common in other species. For species with highly variable seed-set efficiency, the role of resource allocation to flower production in determining differences in seed production among individual plants is likely to be relatively small.","Cunningham, SA","Cunningham, SA",NA,"659",NA,NA,NA,"10.1071/BT99012",NA,"665","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,NA,NA,"J",NA,"2000","Cunningham, Saul A/B-9947-2009","Cunningham, Saul A/0000-0003-0703-6893",NA,NA,NA,"0067-1924","AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY",NA,"What determines the number of seed produced in a flowering event?

Nonrandom spatial distributions of these species in relation to edaphic factors could be one mechanism responsible for maintaining this diversity. We examined the prevalence of nonrandom distributions of trees and palms in relation to soil type and topographic position (""edaphic biases"") over a mesoscale (573 ha) old-growth tropical rain forest (TRF) landscape at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. All trees and palms greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter were measured and identified in 1170 circular 0.01-ha plots centered on an existing 50 x 100 m grid. Topographic position was classified for each plot, and slope and aspect were measured. Soil type data were taken from a previous study (Clark et al. 1998). A total of 5127 trees and palms were identified in 267 species. Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that highly significant edaphic gradients were present, with swamp or highly fertile soils separated from the less fertile, well-drained upland soils. Species composition remained significantly related to topographic position when soil type was controlled for. The main florist ic gradients were still significant when flooded sites were excluded from the analyses. Randomization tests on a weighted preference index were used to examine the relations of individual species to soil types arid, within the dominant soil type, to topographic position. Of the 132 species with N greater than or equal to 5 individuals, 33 showed significant associations with soil type. Within the dominant soil type, 13 of 110 analyzable species were nonrandomly associated with one or more topographic positions.
For a variety of seasons, including issues relating to sample size and adequate edaphic characterization of landscapes, we suggest that the similar to 30% of species shown to be edaphically biased in this study is an underestimate of the true degree of edaphically related distributional biases. To evaluate this hypothesis will require mesoscale vegetation sampling combined with quantitative soil analyses at the same scale in a range of tropical rain forests. If edaphic distributional biases are shown to be common, this suggests that edaphically linked processes leading to differential recruitment are similarly common.","Clark, DB

Using regressions of %N in the decomposing litter against litter mass remaining. we demonstrated similar concentrations of N at all sites when the amount of litter lost was 50%. By using naphthalene, an arthropod repellent, we examined the effect of microarthropods on the N fluxes in the litterbags. Microarthropods had little effect on the %N remaining. At La Selva, the presence of fauna resulted in a marginally significant increase in litter nitrogen concentrations (p <0.06). At both tropical sites, there was a significant net immobilization of N followed by N mineralization after four months. Although there was a net immobilization of N at Coweeta, this lasted for a longer period and the litterbags had not begun to mineralize N after 10 months. We suggest that the rapid accumulation of N in decomposing litter at the tropical sites during the first few months after leaf fall can result in the retention of mobile nitrogen ions in soils. The subsequent mineralization, in later decomposition stages, can make N available to trees during leaf hush. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.","Heneghan, L

This enabled us to quantify the mass loss contributed by the fauna (MLCF) at each site and permitted an analysis of the influence of site-specific differences in the composition of the microarthropod assemblages on decomposition rates. We hypothesized that microarthropod regulation of the microbial populations involved in leaf litter decomposition would be stronger in humid tropical forests, which experience conditions of low climatic variability. In these conditions, there can be an enhanced degree of biotic interactions between microarthropods and their microbial food sources. The elevated extent of these interactions should be expressed as a greater influence of microarthropods at the tropical sites and could result in a site-specific effect of faunal assemblages on decomposition.
Decomposition of the oak litter proceeded faster in Puerto Rican and Costa Rican forests than in a temperate forest in North Carolina, USA. Microarthropods had little effect on decomposition in the temperate forest, whereas their influence was pronounced at tropical sites. Mass loss of litter from plots with reduced microarthropod populations was similar at the tropical sites. When plots with intact faunal communities were compared, differences in the tropical sites were apparent, suggesting that there was a site-specific faunal contribution to decomposition at these sites.
Oribatid mites constituted a dominant component (41-64%) at each of the sites. Species richness of oribatids and Fisher's alpha diversity were similar in each of the three sites. The Shannon index revealed a lower diversity at LUQ. Abundance of microarthropods was lowest at LAS. Species accumulation curves for each site, though similar in form, were distinctive, as were diversity accumulation patterns in samples of increasing size. There was a positive relationship between species richness and the contribution of the fauna to litter mass loss within each site. Thus, species diversity of decomposer fauna may have important ecosystem consequences, particularly in warm moist tropical forests.","Heneghan, L

Species were evaluated based on annual diameter measurements of large samples of individuals in all post-seedling size classes, over a 12-yr period. The study species were seven non-pioneers (Minquartia guianensis, Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Simarouba amara, Dipteryx panamensis, Pithecellobium elegans, and Hyeronima alchorneoides) and two pioneers (Cecropia obtusifolia and C. insignia). For each species, inherent growth capacity through ontogeny was estimated as the mean of the five largest annual increments (from different individuals) in each juvenile and adult size class. At all tree sizes, species differed highly significantly in this measure. In the small sapling sizes (less than or equal to 4-cm diameter), the two pioneers showed markedly higher maximum growth than all the non-pioneers, in line with current understanding. This growth advantage, however, was quickly lost with increasing tree size. For eight of the nine species, the ontogenetic patterns of maximal growth closely corresponded to species groupings previously based on juvenile microsites (forest stage, light levels). Average growth rates, however, which are the combined result of environmental and biotic factors, did not show this correspondence. The groups based on microsite occupancy and growth potential provide a starting point for treating the great numbers of species of tropical rain forest trees as many fewer functional types, a sine qua non for modeling these complex forests. The exceptional growth capacity of one of our focal non-pioneer species (Simarouba) suggests that it represents a hitherto unrecognized functional type among tropical rain forest trees.
The data from this long-term study indicate that several assumptions of current forest-dynamics models are not applicable to trees of this biome, For most species (1) diameter growth during regeneration was not correlated with tree size; (2) adult sizes were not characterized by a constant maximal basal-area increment; and (3) growth capacity did not decline toward zero as trees approached maximum size. Evaluation of overall increment distributions revealed a broad adult size range of exclusively high growth in the emergent Hymenolobium; for two additional species, sectors of the adult size range showed an absence of very low or negative growth. At most sizes, however, all nine species displayed the full range of growth increments, from slightly negative to observed maxima. Describing the performance of tropical rain forest canopy trees will require similar analysis of growth data obtained from many individuals and intervals, and stratified across juvenile and adult life stages. More realistic forest-dynamics models will depend on such evaluations of many tree species, in diverse tropical rain forests. Such models are greatly needed, both for designing management for this biome and for predicting its responses to changing climate and atmospheric conditions.","Clark, DA

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of agroforestry systems on selected soil properties of Haplic and Dystic Fluvisols, in the Atlantic Region of Costa Rica, approximately five years after their establishment. The agroforestry systems were established on unmanaged pastures near the La Selva Biological Station in 1989 and 1990. The original forest had been removed on most of these areas at least 25 years earlier. Three components of the agroforestry systems were the tropical hardwoods Vochysia ferruginea (Botarrama), V. guatemalensis (Chancho), Strypnodendron microstachyum (Vainello) and Hieronyma alchorneoides (Pilon). The soil properties studied included physical (soil bulk density; 0-10 cm), chemical [pH, exchangeable bases, extractable P, soil organic C (SOC) and total soil N; 0-50cm] and biological parameters (mineralizable C and N and microbial biomass C and N; 0-15 cm). Soils were sampled in August 1995. Lower exchangeable bases and soil pH were noted in agroforestry treatments as compared to pastures. Extractable P was higher in the surface 25 cm of agroforestry plots. Total soil N, soil organic C and soil C:N ratios were not influenced by agroforestry systems. Higher mineralizable C levels were observed in pasture surface soils, but no differences in mineralizable N in soil under pasture and agroforestry systems were observed. Soil microbial biomass C and N and specific respiratory activity were not significantly different in pastures and agroforestry systems. Agroforestry systems did not appear to improve soils in this study compared to pasture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Tornquist, CG

This research examined the growth ecology of seedlings and trees of the Neotropical timber species, Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae). Shadehouse experiments, field plantings, and growth rare analyses tested the hypothesis that Carapa seedlings and trees experience higher growth rates in high light levels (recently formed logging gaps or logged forest plots) than in low light levels (old logging gaps or undisturbed forest plots). Consistently poor seedling growth rates under lour light conditions suggest that seedlings establishing in newly formed gaps will be more successful than those establishing in building-phase gaps. Thus, the first year after logging is a critical time for gap recolonization by Carapa and seed casting into gaps after logging is recommended. Growth of Carapa trees was significantly faster in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, and was positively associated with light availability. The results provide evidence chat harvest models can be both diameter- and illumination-based Crown illumination was nor significantly higher in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, indicating that the illumination scale for this study was not sensitive enough to detect increases in light availability brought about by selective logging. Potential silvicultural methods (particularly poison-girdling) that maintain adequate forest light levels in Carapa swamps without significantly altering long-term tree diversity or allowing invasion of secondary species should be explored.","Webb, EL","Webb, EL",NA,"102",NA,NA,NA,"10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00121.x",NA,"110","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAR",NA,"J",NA,"1999","Webb, Edward/E-8343-2011","Webb, Edward/0000-0001-5554-9955",NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"Growth ecology of Carapa nicaraguensis Aublet.

H. alchorneoides, the four species mixture, and II elegans had the greatest accumulations of total aboveground nutrients per hectare. The importance of the plantation floor as a nutrient compartment varied temporally. When forest floor litter biomass was at its peak, plantation floor liner N, Ca, and Mg were roughly equal to, or greater than stem nutrients for all species except for P. elegans. For P. elegans, the plantation floor consistently represented a very low proportion of total aboveground nutrients. G. americana and V. ferruginea trees showed 55-60% less biomass accumulation in mixed than in pure stands while H. alchorneoides and P. elegans trees grew 40-50% more rapidly in mixture. P. elegans foliage had 60% lower Ca but higher P concentrations in mixed than in pure stands, and G. americana had higher foliar Mg in mixed than in pure stands. V. ferruginea stands had the highest concentrations of soil Ca, Mg, and organic matter, particularly in the top layers. Relative to pure plantations, soil nutrient concentrations in mixed plantations were intermediate for N, P, and K, but lower for Ca and Mg.

With maximum likelihood techniques, I fit species-specific, nonlinear regression models of seedling probability of mortality and radial growth as functions of light availability for Trophis racemosa, Castilla elastica, Pourouma aspera, and Cecropia obtusifolia (Family Moraceae, latter two also classified as Cecropiaceae).
Models characterizing mortality in the first year of seedling life showed significant differences among the species, both in functional forms and in model parameter estimates. All species decreased in mortality with increases in light to 20% full sun. Above 20% full sun, the mortality of T. racemosa and Castilla elastica continued to decrease, while that of Cecropia obtusifolia remained constant and that of P. aspera increased. At <10% full sun, there was a fivefold difference in mortality probability; T. racemosa had the highest survivorship, followed by C. elastica, P. aspera, and C. obtusifolia. Mortality models for the initial 4 mo of the experiment revealed significant size effects for all species except P. aspera and increased mortality under high light for P. aspera and T. racemosa.
In contrast, radial growth of all species increased with light availability. The radial growth models, based upon only variation in light availability and tree size, accounted for 60-86% of the variation in growth. Cecropia obtusifolia occupied the lowest rank in radial growth at <50% full sun and the highest radial growth at light levels >75% full sun.
When considered together, the mortality and growth models revealed that differences in species performance could lead to light gradient partitioning. At distinct light levels, each species showed the highest growth relative to other surviving species. Neither growth nor mortality considered alone revealed this specialization. Light gradient partitioning provides an explanation for successional dynamics and suggests that tropical tree species coexistence and diversity is at least partly maintained through niche differentiation.","Kobe, RK","Kobe, RK",NA,"187",NA,NA,NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0187:LGPATT]2.0.CO;2",NA,"201","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"JAN",NA,"J",NA,"1999",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","ECOLOGY",NA,"Light gradient partitioning among tropical tree species through

Bird species differed in both quantity and quality components of seed dispersal.
Bird species that contributed most to the quantity component of seed dispersal were not always the same as those that contributed most to the quality component. Thus, to evaluate the ecological roles of frugivores and their effectiveness as seed dispersers requires integration across various processes involved in seed dispersal (removal, deposition, etc.).

During the flood, the sediments stored by these darns were moved downstream blocking the canal at the apex of the alluvial fan. This blocking forced the flood water to clear its nay through the pre-construction active fan surface where the camp site was located. The flood protection works which was designed to protect the highway failed to shelter the campsite. This campsite was situated on an active part of the alluvial fan which was apparently deactivated by the dams.
The flood discharge in the main stream (Aras) was 420 m(3)sec(-1), generated by the Aso, Betes, and La Selva tributaries that contributed 240, 128 and 62 m(3)sec(-1), respectively.

Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at the intersection points of a gridded 1 ha plot (10 x 10-m grid, 121 samples) and in a nested 100 m(2) subplot (2 x 2-m grid, 36 samples). The 1 ha plot had a density of 4535 seeds/m(2) with 34 species observed. Based on a series of 100 randomized species accumulation curves, a Michaelis-Menten fit predicted a mean species richness of 36.3 species; the number of observed species was close to the predicted asymptote. A nonparametric, first-order jackknife species richness estimator predicted a species richness of 37.0 species. Eighty-five and 95 percent of the observed species richness is contained, on average, within 41 and 74 pooled samples, respectively. Within the 100 m2 nested subplot, a density of 5476 seeds/m(2) was observed, comprising 26 species with an estimated species richness (Michaelis-Menten fit) of 29.1 species. The jackknife species richness estimator predicted a species richness of 36.7 species. For species richness and abundance of both plots, spacial autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I) were not significantly different from zero at lag distances from 2 to 100 m, indicating a random distribution at these spatial scales. For this sire, accurate estimates of species composition depend upon the number of samples collected as well as the spatial distribution of sampling effort.

This high relief basin is composed of three subbasins, Aso, Betes and La Selva, and feeds the Aras alluvial fan, in the Gallego river valley. This alluvial fan had been drained by an artificial channel (about 125 m(3)/s at bank-full capacity). More than 30 check dams in its feeder channel, the Arris barranco, had been previously filled by earlier sediments. The heaviest rain was over the Betes subbasin (total rainfall 178.4 mm; maximum rainfall intensity of 153 mm/h for a 10-min time interval was estimated). Most of the rainfall fell in a 70-min period. This storm resulted in high runoff, causing catastrophic damage and significant geomorphic changes in the drainage basin, especially in the Betes subbasin. The high discharge, concentrated in the Aras barranco, destroyed most of the check dams, flushing out a great amount of debris. Major channel trenching and widening occurred in this barranco. When the confined sediment-laden flash flood reached the basin mouth, it sheet-flooded the southern sector of the Arris fan depositing a massive amount of debris. On this fan 87 people lost their lives and the direct physical damage has been estimated at 55 million dollars. Two stages in the development of the flood have been differentiated from the sedimentological and morphological analysis of the flooded fan lobe. A first stage (peak discharge) of sheet-flooding deposited a coarse boulder lobe, burying the artificial channel at the fan head and causing a damming effect on the water flood. During the second stage (discharge decline) the flood made its way through the fan head, incising the previous debris accumulation and splitting into two main now paths.

Recent taxonomic studies question whether the Acromyrmex octospinosus populations on the Pacific and Atlantic slopes of Costa Rica are a single species. We therefore examined the foraging and nesting ecology of A. octospinosus in the tropical dry forest of Pale Verde National Park on the Pacific slope of Costa Rica and compared our findings with published data on the ecology of A. octospinosus in the tropical moist forest of La Selva Biological Station on the Atlantic slope. The Pacific A. octospinosus foraged primarily on the leaves of herbs and other small plants, fallen leaves, fruit, flowers, and insect frass, but does not cut the leaves of large trees. Worker size distribution within colonies was bimodal with only the larger workers leaving the nest to forage. Nests were shallow and generally under a few centimeters of organic debris at the base of trees and woody shrubs or in crevices. The foraging and nesting ecology of the Pacific A. octospinosus appeared to be very similar to that of the Atlantic A. octospinosus, except that the Pacific ants collected considerable amounts of insect frass (11% of all loads), whereas the Atlantic ants had no recorded loads of frass. This difference in selectivity, however, may have been due simply to seasonal differences in availability of frass at the sites.
Acromyrmex octospinosus was the only species of leaf-cutting ant found at Pale Verde. The vertisol soil of the area, which has very poor drainage when wet and cracks deeply when dry, may not be suitable for major pest species of leaf-cutters in Costa Rica, Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica, which excavate nests deep underground.","Wetterer, JK

This approach has revealed Features of within-forest heterogencity that had remained ""invisible during extensive fieldwork by mane researchers at La Selva. Examples are: a doubling in density of the guild of subcanopy and canopy palms between flat terrain and increasing steep topography; strong shifts in density of many palm and tree species over La Selva's limited gradients of soils and topography: evidence of human harvesting of one palm species from old-growth Forest: and evidence suggesting indigenous human activity deep within the reserve (the co-occurrence of a previously unrecognized zone of alluvial soil, buried charcoal, and an avocado tree). These studies have also added 15 tree species to the known flora of this intensively researched forest.

We measured the diversity and abundance of understorey plants (<1 m in height) in the area around active and abandoned nests of leaf-cutting ants (Atta cephalotes) at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Sample quadrats on active nests had reduced diversity (number of morphospecies) and abundance of both small (height <10 cm) and large (10 cm(-1) m) understorey plants, when compared to the nearby forest floor (3 and 13 m from the nest edge). Abandoned nests had greater diversity and marginally greater abundance of small understorey plants relative to nearby forest; there was no difference in diversity or abundance of large understorey plants. Leaf-cutting ant nests create gaps in the plant understorey when active, but serve as centres of recruitment for small plants after they are abandoned. Thus, like canopy gaps, ant nests could play an important role in recruitment of new individuals and maintenance of plant species diversity in tropical forests.","Garrettson, M

Studies of woody regeneration in 6 year old experimental plantations and on-farm plantations on abandoned pasture were conducted at the La Selva Biological Station and surrounding region. The experimental plantations include seven native and four exotic tree species, together with an abandoned pasture control. The impact of plantations on woody regeneration varied according to the plantation tree species. Some species fostered greater abundance of woody regeneration, some greater species richness, other species both abundance and richness, while another group had no effect significantly different from abandoned pasture. Abundance of woody regeneration did not appear to be related to canopy cover at the time of sampling, Nevertheless, plantation trees that established rapidly and had high growth rates did in general stimulate higher levels of woody regeneration. A comparison of this study with one conducted in the same plantations Is months later indicates that the effect of some trees promoting greater density of regeneration may decline over time, while differences in species richness may persist or strengthen. Observations in a range of 6 year old plantations on farms showed a wide range of densities of woody regeneration. Part of this variation could be explained by the presence or absence of grazing within the plantation. Abundance and species richness of woody regeneration under plantation stands can be substantial. Nevertheless, the incidence of mature forest species was low and their ability to invade in the future will probably depend on subsequent stand management. It must not be forgotten that the motivation for reforestation is primarily economic; increased biodiversity is a by-product that, if it is to be promoted, will require adaptation of management practices.

Quantitatively structured inventory can improve inventory efficiency (defined as the steepness of species accumulation curves). As part of the Arthropods of La Selva project (ALAS), a structured inventory of the ants of a lowland tropical rain forest was carried out. A novel method of sample processing was developed, in which parataxonomists prepared specimens based on their own sorting of morphospecies within samples (repeating the process for each sample, and thus not attempting to crossreference morphospecies among samples), and a taxonomic specialist later sorted the resultant pool of prepared specimens. Efficacy of stratifying by sampling method (Berlese samples, Malaise traps, and canopy fogging), habitat, and time was investigated. Novel methods of analysis were used, including (1) curves depicting cost in prepared specimens of adding species to the inventory, as a function of number of species already captured, (2) within-vs. among-treatment species accumulation curves, and (3) matched rank-abundance plots. Over 400 species of ants are known from the site, of which the structured inventory captured 253. Projection of the species accumulation curve revealed that continuation of the same methods would not be an efficient method of capturing additional species, and that additional methods would be needed. Considered separately, Berlese, Malaise, and fogging samples were similarly efficient. Berlese samples combined with either Malaise or fogging samples were far more efficient than single methods because the faunas they sampled were highly complementary. Combining Malaise and fogging samples did not increase efficiency because the faunas they sampled had low complementarity At the scale of our sampling, there was little evidence that spatial, temporal, or habitat stratification increased efficiency of inventory for Berlese and Malaise samples. For canopy fogging, processing a portion of the catch from multiple trees was more efficient than processing the entire catch from one tree. However, stratifying by tree species did not improve efficiency.","Longino, JT

The 14 species were categorized according to maximum attainable size (five canopy, seven subcanopy and two understorey species).
2 Within each maximum-size category, the relative frequency of trees of 2-8 cm d.b.h. (trunk diameter at breast height) in gaps compared with closed-canopy stands differed between species. In the closed-canopy stands, the positions of the crowns in the heterogeneous canopy differed between species within each of the canopy and subcanopy categories at 8-40 cm d.b.h.
3 We regressed the relationship between d.b.h. and crown architecture by a non-linear allometric equation for the 14 species. There was a continuum from wide-crown species to narrow-crown species within canopy and subcanopy categories at 2-16 cm d.b.h. The two understorey species were wide-crown species throughout their ontogeny.
4 Interspecific differences in both rate of increase of d.b.h. and mortality over 10 years (1983-93) were detected within the canopy and subcanopy categories.
5 Principal component analysis based on five architectural and life-history traits revealed species differentiation within the canopy and subcanopy categories, reflecting a trade-off between responsiveness to increasing light in narrow-crown species and shade tolerance in wide-crown species. Multiple regression analyses suggested that most of these traits could be predicted by the light environments experienced by species rather than by species' maximum sizes. We concluded that species differentiation in this community was primarily related to different regeneration behaviour in gaps by trees of 2-8 cm d.b.h., and to different space occupation in the heterogeneous canopy at 8-16 cm d.b.h.","Aiba, SI

These results indicate that basal area and stem density of trees in the upper levels of the forest canopy are poor predictors of light penetration to the understorey. One hypothesis suggested here is that dense subcanopy and understorey vegetation in tropical secondary forests can strongly influence understorey light levels. Alternatively, light transmittance characteristics of the upper forest canopy may be influenced by species-specific differences in canopy architecture or foliage density that vary independently from tree diameter and density.","Kabakoff, RP

We sought to determine why white faced capuchins at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica produce these food-associated calls. Here we analyze the contests in which this intra-group vocalization was emitted, including the spatial responses elicited from other troop members. A cumulative 26.6 h of continuous focal samples and 3314 spectrograms (including 1643 huhs) were analyzed from a study troop with 16 focal subjects. The mean individual rate of huhs was greater (1) during foraging versus nonforaging activities; (2) during fruit foraging compared to both visual searching for foraging sites and foraging for arthropod prey; and (3) when the nearest neighbor was within a 10 m radius of the focal animal compared to when the nearest neighbor was at greater distances. A huh also predicted a significant increase in nearest-neighbour distance; on average, mean nearest-neighbor distance increased 3 m within 2 min following a huh vocalization. Null models of change in mean nearest-neighbor distance over time were generated from the original data set by treating predetermined time points (140 s intervals) in the focal recordings as if those points marked instances at which huhs were produced by the focal subject. No significant alterations in nearest-neighbor distance were detected within time lags up to 100 s in these null models, supporting the conclusion that huhs are causally linked with subsequent increases in nearest-neighbor distances. Huhs were most evident when capuchins were within dense fruit patches, hut these calls were produced across all foraging contests. Our results suggest that huhs may not be food calls in the usual sense (i.e. informing others of the location of food sources to be shared), but may be more appropriately described as spacing calls. Huhs probably act to increase foraging efficiency by reducing overlap in foraging areas with other troop members.","Boinski, S

"430","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Light is a key resource controlling tree regeneration in the understory of closed-canopy old-growth forests. To evaluate the distribution of understory light environments at a landscape scale, we used stratified random sampling in a 500-ha stand of Costa Rican tropical rain forest. Fifteen 100 m long transects were placed using random coordinates within two soil-geomorphology units (flat alluvial terraces and dissected ridge-slope-swale terrain). At 2.5-m intervals we measured canopy height and slope angle, classified topographic position, and took canopy photographs with a fish-eye lens at 1 and 3 m above the ground (and at 0.6 and 5 m height at five stations per transect). Photographs were analyzed for global site factor (GSF), which is analogous to the percentage of full sun radiation reaching a point. Canopy height and GSF at 1 and 3 m above the ground were significantly autocorrelated (Moran's I) at 2.5-m intervals. The autocorrelation rapidly declined at greater intervals, reaching nonsignificance at ca. 20 m. Both canopy height and GSF at 3 m height had a weak tendency for negative autocorrelations at intervals of 25-50 m. Median canopy height (615 stations) was 23 m (range 0-37). Caps (canopy height less than or equal to 2 m, Brokaw 1982) were only 1.5% of sample points. Caps were more frequent on steep slopes than on terraces, ridgetops, swales, and gentle slopes. Canopy height varied significantly across this topographic gradient. At all four heights (0.6, 1, 3, and 5 m) median GSF was less than or equal to 2.4%. GSF values > 8% accounted for only 3% of the total sample (N = 1380). GSF was only weakly negatively correlated with canopy height and the relation was not monotonic. Under canopies 13-19 m tall, nearly all GSF values were less than or equal to 5%. Higher GSFs were more frequent under both shorter and taller canopies. Given the observed variance in GSF and canopy height, 100-200 points separated by intervals of greater than or equal to 20 m are necessary to measure the forest-wide means of these variables to +/- 10%. We discuss implications of these results for current approaches to modeling understory light based on canopy characteristics We compared the random background of light environments from 1-3 m above the ground at La Selva with those occupied by saplings of pioneer and nonpioneer tree species. The two pioneers (Cecropia spp.) occurred in microsites significantly brighter than random sites, while sapling microsites of all five nonpioneer species were significantly darker than random. Comparing the landscape-scale distribution of key resources with species' actual distributions at similar scales offers a quantitative method for assessing plant life histories within and among forests.","Clark, DB

I collected fresh fecal samples from individual howler monkeys from two focal troops from October 1991 through October 1992. The presence of parasite ova and larvae in samples was determined by using a formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation technique. Three types of endoparasites were found: (1) a roundworm, Parabronema sp., (2) a physalopterid roundworm, species undetermined, and (3) a fluke, species undetermined. No differences were found in the prevalence of parasitic infections between sexes or troops. No statistical differences were found between the sexes fro the intensity of infection. The troop that lived along the river showed a statistically significant higher intensity of nematode infection that the troop that lived mostly in primary forest. Parabronema sp. was found only from individuals in the river group. The prevalence of parasitic infection observed in howlers at La Selva (100%) is higher than has been reported for howlers in a dry deciduous forest at La Pacifica, Costa Rica (47%). Microclimatic factors, ranging patterns, and home-range size are identified as important variables that may affect parasitic infections of howler populations. Data from this study suggest that narrow corridor designs may be inappropriate for conservation of primates and possibly other species of arboreal animals.","Stoner, KE","Stoner, KE",NA,"539",NA,NA,NA,"10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10020539.x",NA,"546","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"APR",NA,"J",NA,"1996","Stoner, Kathryn E/E-1510-2015","Stoner, Kathryn E/0000-0002-9964-1697",NA,NA,NA,"0888-8892","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY",NA,"Prevalence and intensity of intestinal parasites in mantled howling

2 A total of 14 plots with a total area of 23.4 hectares was censused; all stems greater than or equal to 10 cm d.b.h. were tagged, identified, mapped, and measured in diameter and height.
3 Altogether 11 478 live stems greater than or equal to 10 cm d.b.h. were encountered in the 1988-89 census, representing 561 species in 91 families,
4 Canopy height was greatest at 300 m, decreasing both above and below that altitude, and reaching a minimum at the summit. Mean stem diameter remained constant from the base of the gradient to 1500 m a.s.l., increasing slightly at higher altitudes. Large-diameter trees were least abundant at middle altitudes. Basal area was greatest near the summit, exceeding 40 m(2) ha(-1) in the two highest plots.
5 Diversity was highest at 300 m, with 149 species and 55 families per hectare. There was a progressive decrease both above and below this altitude in species richness, species diversity, number of families, and the number of species per family. Diversity was lowest at the summit.
6 Five life-forms were recorded: dicot trees comprised 78.0% of stems; palms 14.9%; tree ferns 5.2%; lianas 1.5%; and hemi-epiphytes 0.4%. Life-form distribution varied markedly over the gradient.

The species x site sum of squares was partitioned in order to identify high yielding species that are generalists and high yielding species that may be specialists. The contribution of each species to the species x site interaction term was determined: four species were found to contribute 61% of the interaction (Ochroma pyramidale, 26.5%; Gmelina arborea, 13.1%; Terminalia superba, 11.2%; and Acacia mangium, 10.3%).

Three stable species with above average tree volume (Vochysia guatemalensis, Jacaranda copaia, and Goethalsia meiantha) show potential for reforestation over large regions where plantation maintenance is minimal. The identification of several high yielding unstable exotic species helps to explain their uneven success in plantations in Costa Pica.

"434","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","I conducted a 15-month ecological study of habitat preferences and activity and foraging patterns of two troops of mantled howling monkeys, Alouatta palliata, in a lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Reserve in northeastern Costa Rica. The two troops specialized on different habitats in spire of the fact that both of them had all habitats available and were not constrained by neighboring troops since the population density of howlers is low (7-15 howlers/km(2)). Troop 1 spent the majority of time in primary forest (80%) followed by secondary forest (10%), while troop 2 spent the majority of time in undisturbed riparian habitat (60%) followed by primary forest (30%). Habitat sampling indicates that neither the total number of stems, species, or families nor the diversity (Shannon index) or evenness is a good indicator for howler habitat selection. Instead the density of trees from the 12 species most commonly consumed by each troop is the most important factor. Activity and foraging patterns were not dependent upon the season as has been described for howling monkeys in forests with a more pronounced dry season at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and La Pacifica in northwestern Costa Rica. This is likely a result of the more constant food supply at La Selva, combined with less intraspecific competition due to the low howler density. The intraspecific variability of foraging patterns and troop-specific habitat specialization observed in Alouatta palliata should be considered in the conservation biology of primates. Primate relocation programs should include not only an ecological assessment of the release site but also a comparison of the release site with the habitat that the groups currently occupy.","Stoner, KE","Stoner, KE",NA,"1",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/BF02696156",NA,"30","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"FEB",NA,"J",NA,"1996","Stoner, Kathryn E/E-1510-2015","Stoner, Kathryn E/0000-0002-9964-1697",NA,NA,NA,"0164-0291","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY",NA,"Habitat selection and seasonal patterns of activity and foraging of

Owing to the scarcity of individuals of a given species and the difficulty of accurate measurement, there are few species-level data on the growth, mortality, and abundance of species that regularly reach emergent status. We report such data for very large individuals from old-growth tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station in the Atlantic lowlands of the Republic of Costa Rica. The landscape-scale abundance of all species reaching over 70 cm diameter was assessed using 515 0.01-ha quadrats located at grid points in a 500 ha area of old-growth forest. In the total sample of 2301 stems 10 cm or more in diameter, very large individuals accounted for 2% of the stems, 23% of the basal area, and 27% of the estimated above-ground biomass. Growth and survival for five species that regularly attain emergent status were measured in a 150 ha area within the 500 ha plot. Survival of 282 very large individuals of the five species was measured over 6 years. The mean annual mortality rate of the total sample was only 0.6% year(-1). Mean annual diameter growth increments varied from 1.9 to 5.2 mm year(-1) among species, and were negatively correlated with diameter in four of the five species. For a sample of 193 individuals measured over 7 years, growth almost exactly equalled losses in basal area and biomass due to mortality. Because all of these species are regularly recruiting new trees into the over 70 cm diameter class, the amount of biomass in the large-individual size class is increasing over the 150 ha old-growth study area. Historic disturbance and/or current climatic change are hypothesized to account for the increase. We identify lack of standard diameter measurement criteria, and small and potentially unrepresentative plot locations as two problems in assessing the role of very large trees in other neotropical forests. Future studies should sample larger areas; this will increase the generality of the conclusions and will make possible a species-level comparison of the ecology of very large tropical trees.","Clark, DB

The study showed that allometric differences between species are related to adult size, regeneration niche (gap vs. non-gap) and longevity, as follows: (1) adults of understorey species are larger crowned than similar statured (6-15 m) saplings of canopy trees; (2) species commonly found in gaps as saplings are somewhat larger crowned than shade-tolerant species over the 1-6 m height range; and (3) long-lived canopy species show greater increases in crown breadth with increasing height than do short-lived species. Trunkallometryis related to mechanical requirements for support, including the need to withstand greater wind forces in the upper canopy. The common canopy species, Pentaclethra macroloba, which comprises 40% of the basal area at La Selva, is particularly wide-crowned and thick-trunked at its maximum height. On the other hand, the comparatively narrower crowns and trunks of the other canopy species allow them to reach a given height with less biomass.

Within 568 ha of nonswamp old-growth lowland forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we sampled at 516 intersections of a reserve-wide grid to systematically assess the species' distributions across the major edaphic gradients. We found mosaics of community structure related to marked within-forest variability in both soil and topography. Total stem density of this guild varied with both edaphic factors. Steep sites had twice as many large palms (>10 m tall) per hectare than those on gentler topography or at lower slope positions. The combined density of subcanopy and canopy palms also varied significantly among soil types in the smallest size class (1-5 m tall), but not for larger individuals. Local (point) species richness of the subcanopy and canopy palms varied among soil types.
Of the seven species, two (Astrocaryum alatum and A. confertum) were rare. All others showed significant edaphic variation in their distribution and/or estimated density. Two closely related species had strong and opposite edaphic associations. Euterpe macrospadix was biased toward steep topography and less fertile sites. Prestoea decurrens was nearly ommipresent on soil types with gentle topography while absent from half the points on soils with steep slopes. Two other closely related species, Iriartea deltoidea and Socratea exorrhiza, while virtually omnipresent across soil types and topographic positions, showed marked reciprocal variation in density between related soils. Iriartea's spatial distribution further indicates local removal of this species from one sector of the old growth by human harvesting (with subsequent apparent ''release'' of Socratea in this site). The most abundant species, Welfia georgii, while present at all sample points, showed significant among-soil variation in density.
This substructuring of the arborescent palm guild results from the interplay of edaphic variation and past human activity. These findings and evidence from other sites suggest that marked spatial heterogeneity in community structure, at small to large scales (0.5-10(3) ha), may be general among tropical wet forests. Study of the spatial scales and causes of this variability will produce a more robust understanding of these complex ecosystems.","CLARK, DA

The objective of our study is to evaluate the spatial dispersion of alleles within and among subpopulations of a tropical shrub, Psychotria officinalis (Rubiaceae), in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. This insect-pollinated, self-incompatible understory plant is dispersed primarily by birds, some species of which drop the seeds immediately while others transport seeds away from the parent plant. Thus, pollination should promote gene flow while at least one type of seed dispersal agent might restrict gene flow. Sampling from five subpopulations in undisturbed wet forest at Estacion Biologica La Selva, Costa Rica, we used electrophoretically detected isozyme markers to examine the spatial scale of genetic structure. Our goals are: 1) describe genetic diversity of each of the five subpopulations of Psychotria officinalis sampled within a contiguous wet tropical forest; 2) evaluate fine-scale genetic structure of adults of P. officinalis within a single 2.25-ha mapped plot; and 3) estimate genetic structure of P. officinalis using data from five subpopulations located up to 2 km apart. Using estimates of coancestry, statistical analyses reveal significant positive genetic correlations between individuals on a scale of 5 m but no significant genetic relatedness beyond that interplant distance within the studied subpopulation. Multilocus estimates of genetic differentiation among subpopulations were low, but significant (F-st = 0.095). Significant F-st estimates were largely attributable to a single locus (Lap-2). Thus, multilocus estimates of F-st may be influenced by microgeographic selection. If true, then the observed levels of IBD may be overestimates.","LOISELLE, BA

"441","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","This paper seeks to clarify the ecological and evolutionary impacts of foraging for arthropods vs. nectar in hummingbirds, using data on morphology, sites, and tactics of arthropod foraging, and prey taken by ii species of hummingbirds of La Selva, a Costa Rican lowland wet forest, as well as information on time budgets of male and female hummingbirds from two other sites. Hermit hummingbirds have long, curved bills and are nearly exclusively understory hover-gleaners that take mostly spiders. Most glean from webs but Threnetes ruckeri differs in foraging behavior and takes mostly jumping spiders. Nonhermits have shorter, straighter bills and employ a greater range of foraging tactics and sites, taking a wider variety of prey. In most species flycatching is frequent and flies and wasps are the predominant prey items, but some also take many spiders and ants; in particular, Heliothryx barroti is predominantly a hover-gleaner of the canopy and takes more spiders than flies. In Thalurania colombica, males and females differ in sites and tactics of arthropod foraging during the breeding season but not at other times. Breeding female hummingbirds spend much more time foraging for arthropods than do males in the same times and places, although flower visitation still, constitutes the majority of foraging time.
Among La Selva hummingbirds, bill curvature is strongly correlated with the proportion of gleaning vs. hawking, and with the proportion of prey taken from the substrate (spiders, ants) as opposed to volant prey (flies, wasps). Broad wings (low aspect ratio) and high wing disk loading are correlated with hovering, gleaning, and the proportion of spiders and ants in the diet; narrow wings and high wing disk loading, with flycatching. Except for the three species that engage in the most flycatching, females have broader wings than males and in virtually all species, females have higher wing disk loading. However, no parameter of wing morphology shows a clear relationship to strategies of nectar exploitation, probably reflecting the facultative nature of the latter.
Hermits and nonhermits differ strongly in their preferred foraging levels in the vegetation, both for nectar and for arthropods, with the former using the understory almost exclusively, the latter using the canopy to a much greater extent, in both forest and second growth. Nevertheless, the two groups do not differ in the proportion of foraging attempts for nectar vs. arthropods, nor in the distribution of foraging through the day, in either habitat. In nearly all species, bills of females are longer than those of males, and this could increase their ability to forage for arthropods at least as much as for nectar.
Much of the controversy regarding frequency and energetic importance of arthropod foraging vs. flower visitation reflects the biases inherent in observing each type of foraging or in interpreting data from stomach contents or emetic samples, or from failure to consider the specific tactics of foraging for arthropods. Reports that hummingbirds can exist for extended periods or breed without access to nectar or alternative sugar sources require confirmation, as does a report that availability of arthropods rather than nectar determines hummingbird breeding seasonality in dry areas. The major impact of arthropods in hummingbirds' diets appears to be at the daily, rather than seasonal, level. Data on arthropod prey do not support the notion that hummingbirds visit flowers for insects rather than nectar, and there is no evidence to suggest that their bills are specialized for extracting insects from flowers. Rather, it appears that the bills of hummingbirds are adapted to extracting nectar from particular types of flowers, and that these bill specializations in turn constrain the tactics of arthropod foraging-in particular, the long, curved bills of the hermits might preclude effective flycatching. Selection on wing morphology from flower visitation might well be mostly indirect, via constraints on arthropod foraging tactics imposed by bill morphology, rather than directly through nectar foraging strategies. There is no basis for considering hermits to be more insectivorous than nonhermits; they represent a separate radiation within the Trochilidae, in a different habitat and in association with a different group of flowers, than do several major radiations of the nonhermits.","STILES, FG","STILES, FG",NA,"853",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/1369527",NA,"878","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"NOV",NA,"J",NA,"1995",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0010-5422","CONDOR",NA,"BEHAVIORAL, ECOLOGICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF FORAGING FOR

"442","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","A null model for the effects of treefall gaps on tree species diversity of tropical rain forests is based on the well-known relationship between abundance and diversity: habitats supporting larger numbers of individuals can support more populations and more species than habitats supporting small numbers of individuals. Because seedling establishment and sapling density increase following canopy opening, gaps are often also sites of high species diversity. Both tree density and diversity are likely to be greater in areas of high stand-turnover rates. Thinning and non-catastrophic mortality reduce both density and diversity in areas of low gap frequency.
Nevertheless, natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as logging, have been hypothesized to both enhance and limit species diversity through changes in habitat heterogeneity, shifts in competitive balances among species, and creation of otherwise-rare habitats. Species-accumulation curves can be used to evaluate these alternatives by comparing observed species-abundance patterns with expected changes in diversity due to density effects alone. Topographic variation in density and diversity of shrubs and small saplings at the La Selva (Costa Rica) Biological Station preserve was analyzed as an example. The total number of species for each of 18 sites was estimated by fitting a two-parameter hyperbola (similar to the Michaelis-Menten equation) to sample data using a maximum-likelihood method. Although both density and diversity were higher on slopes than on ridges, total species richness was nevertheless higher on slopes than is predictable from density effects alone. High stand-turnover rates on slopes may enhance tree species diversity through increases in tree density and in habitat heterogeneity.","DENSLOW, JS","DENSLOW, JS",NA,"962",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/2269347",NA,"968","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"NOV",NA,"J",NA,"1995",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1051-0761","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS",NA,"DISTURBANCE AND DIVERSITY IN TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS - THE DENSITY EFFECT","WOS:A1995TF37500012","5",NA,NA,442

A cumulative 26.6 hours of continuous samples and 3,314 spectrograms (including 1,295 trills) were analysed from a study troop with 16 focal subjects.

Primatol. 30, p. 85-100). At both sites, (1) trills were closely associated with the initiation of movement by a stationary troop in a specific direction. (2) Trills were emitted at a much higher rate in the leading edge of a travelling troop than in following positions. (3) Individuals often reinforced the efforts of other troop members to coordinate troop movement. (4) Lack of consensus among troop members over the travel route was evident. (5) In rare instances trills were employed in tactical maneuvers suggestive of intentionality and the ability to anticipate behavioural effects. Differences in the usage of trills at these two sites were also detected. (1) At La Selva all troop members, with the exception of infants, used trills in the coordination of troop movement, whereas at Santa Rosa marked age, sex and rank distinctions in the extent of participation were apparent. (2) Capuchins at Santa Rosa altered the trajectory of travelling troops with trills, even reversing directions, but not at La Selva. These disparities may follow from differences between the sites in the extent of visual and auditory contact typical among troop members, social structure, susceptibility to predation, and possible genetic variation.","BOINSKI, S

The abandoned palm orchard had lower basal area and stem density than other secondary forests of the same age. It also had significantly smaller nitrate (NaOH-extractable) and organic pbosphorus pools and significantly lower net rates of nitrogen-mineralization and nitrification. It is evident that preserving tree cover does not necessarily maintain soil fertility.

The degree of damage was based on amounts typically destroyed by Hypsipyla grandella, a serious lepidopteran pest of C. odorata. From 14-month-old plantations at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, three treatments were established based on the length of shoot and number of leaves removed: controls (no tissue removed), moderate damage, and severe damage. Initial starch concentrations were compared with concentrations observed 18 to 30 days following shoot removal using enzymatic starch hydrolysis and colorimetry. Root starch concentrations increased in undamaged trees, decreased slightly in the moderately damaged trees, and decreased markedly in severely damaged trees during the sampling period. Starch concentrations in lower boles did not decrease following shoot damage, suggesting a specific role of root search reserves in responding to aboveground carbon requirements. The dry weights of regrown shoots were similar for the moderately and severely damaged trees, but severely damaged trees produced numerous basal shoots while moderately damaged trees produced only one or two terminal shoots near the point of excision. Decreases in root search concentrations following shoot damage and rapid shoot regrowth suggest that starch remobilization in roots of C. odorata might provide a survival mechanism after attack by H. grandella.","RODGERS, HL

Studies of adaptability and growth under these conditions are scarce, particularly for native species. In this paper we present data on growth and tree form at 3 years of age for 11 species planted in abandoned pastures. The research plantation was established at La Selva Biological Station, in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica (10 degrees 26'N, 83 degrees 59'W). Survival, diameter at breast height (DBH),total height, basal area, volume index and tree form were used to evaluate the species performance. After 3 years, Vochysia guatemalensis displayed a survival significantly higher (98%) than that of the other species. The lowest survival was 75% for Pinus tecunumanii. There were significant differences in growth measures among species. Acacia mangium exhibited significantly higher growth rates than the other species. Although this species grew rapidly, it did not develop straight single stems. About 14% of trees of A. mangium had bifurcation below DBH and more than 50% showed multiple axes or branches as large in diameter as the principal axis. The native species with the highest growth rate was Vochysia guatemalensis (DBH 12.7 cm, total height 7.5 m, volume index 55 m(3) ha(-1) at 3 years of age). Vochysia ferruginea exhibited a slightly lower growth rate. Both Vochysia species were ranked highly with regard to tree form, with more than 80% straight single stemmed trees. The lowest growth rates were exhibited by Pentaclethra macraloba, Pirhecellobium macradenium and Virola koschnyi; however, the latter two species formed straight single stems. Pentaclethra macroloba and Inga edulis failed to form straight single stems. In general, the growth rates of the species studied were high in comparison with results reported from other tree plantations in the tropics. In spite of this, it is not prudent to draw final conclusions on the basis of these 3 year measurements.","GONZALEZ, JE

The study species included five emergents and one canopy species.
2 Adult diameter increments varied markedly from year to year for all species. In the year of highest growth for individual species, mean increments were 25-112% greater than in the year of least growth. These among-year differences were significant for five of the six species.
3 The variation in adult growth rates showed strong temporal concordance across species. For all six species, mean adult diameter increments were higher than average in 1985 and were lower than average in 1986 and 1988.
4 Marked year to year growth differences were also shown by juvenile trees of these species. In the class greater than or equal to 50 cm tall and less than or equal to 1 cm in diameter, mean diameter increments were 3-10 times greater in the year of highest growth than in the year of least growth. In each of the other two juvenile size classes (1-10 cm and 10-30 cm in diameter), two species showed highly significant among-year growth variation.
5 Within all three juvenile size classes, the year to year growth variation showed significant temporal concordance across species. As for adults, 1985 and/or 1984 were among the two highest growth years.
6 That these patterns of interyear growth differences were shared across tree species and between saplings and adults demonstrates significant impacts of climatic variability on the productivity of this 'equable' ecosystem.
7 Annual rainfall was not correlated with the annual growth patterns. Although the two years of highest overall growth, 1984 and 1985, were exceptionally dry, adult trees of two species showed their greatest growth in one of the highest rainfall years (1990).
8 Recent studies suggest that photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) controls productivity of tropical wet forests. Recent data from La Selva show strong year to year variation in monthly PAR. Demonstration of a causal relationship will, however, require concurrent measurement of tree growth, PAR, and other climatic factors.
9 Marked temporal variation in tree growth in tropical wet forests will have pervasive consequences for many processes in these complex ecosystems. Moreover, the degree of climatic sensitivity found in this study indicates that tropical rain forests could be strongly affected by global climate change.","CLARK, DA

The species were Simarouba amara, a fast-growing species associated with gaps in old-growth forest and abundant in secondary forest, and Minquartia guianensis, a slow-growing species tolerant of low-light conditions in old-growth forest. Per unit of bole surface, CO2 efflux averaged 1.24 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for Simarouba and 0.83 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for Minquartia. CO2 efflux was highly correlated with annual wood production (r(2) = 0.65), but only weakly correlated with stem diameter (r(2) = 0.22). We also partitioned the CO2 efflux into the functional components of construction and maintenance respiration. Construction respiration was estimated from annual stem dry matter production and maintenance respiration by subtracting construction respiration from the instantaneous CO2 flux. Estimated maintenance respiration was linearly related to sapwood volume (39.6 mu mol m(-3) s(-1) at 24.6 degrees C, r(2) = 0.58), with no difference in the rate for the two species. Maintenance respiration per unit of sapwood volume for these tropical wet forest trees was roughly twice that of temperate conifers. A model combining construction and maintenance respiration estimated CO2 very well for these species (r(2) = 0.85). For our sample, maintenance respiration was 54% of the total CO2 efflux for Simarouba and 82% for Minquartia. For our sample, sapwood volume averaged 23% of stem volume when weighted by tree size, or 40% with no size weighting. Using these fractions, and a published estimate of aboveground dry-matter production, we estimate the annual. cost of woody tissue respiration for primary forest at La Selva to be 220 or 350 g C m(-2) year(-1), depending on the assumed sapwood volume. These costs are estimated to be less than 13% of the gross production for the forest.","RYAN, MG

The estimate of 15 troops (7-15 howlers/km2) provided by the duster analysis is similar to an independent census of the same population using the triangulation technique.  These data indicate the potential usefulness of duster analysis methods to estimate minimum number of primate troops within an area. Cluster analysis has several advantages over more traditional primate census techniques: the assumption that it is necessary to achieve reliable estimates from line transect sampling is not required (i.e., points directly on the line will never be missed); census data can be collected by one person making it easier logistically than conducting a census with the triangulation technique which requires many people; census data collected over a brief period of dme can be used to provide quantitative estimates of population density; and observations provided by others in the survey area during the time period of the census may be used. Cluster analysis is recommended when attempting to estimate population densities of primates in tall evergreen forests where visibility is poor, when animals have long inactive periods, few or unpredictable vocalizations, and/or occupy the top of the canopy. The duster method of analyzing broad survey data may also be applicable to other territorial mammalian populations that are difficult to census by other means.","STONER, KE","STONER, KE",NA,"332",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/2388855",NA,"340","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"SEP",NA,"J",NA,"1994","Stoner, Kathryn E/E-1510-2015","Stoner, Kathryn E/0000-0002-9964-1697",NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"POPULATION-DENSITY OF THE MANTLED HOWLER MONKEY (ALOUATTA-PALLIATA) AT

A long-term (12 yr) survey of flowering in 254 lowland tropical rain forest trees of 173 species from the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica showed highly diverse, irregular, and complex patterns. Analysis of this survey data relied primarily on graphical analyses that provide data representation methods rather than numerical summaries that provide data reduction methods. The classification differs from previous ones in three ways. It uses, as the primary criterion, frequency of the time series, based on explicit time and amplitude scales, so that irregular temporal sequences are revealed. It features a system of subsidiary classes based on other quantitative descriptors: regularity, duration, amplitude, date, and synchrony. Finally, the conceptual framework separates patterns at each level of analysis so that adding the time series at one level produces a time series for the next higher level. Levels are hierarchical from the flower to the individual, population, and community with additional non-nested levels such as the guild. The four basic classes-continual, subannual, annual, and supra-annual-are applied to patterns at any level of analysis. The classification system provides a logical framework for quantitative description of phenological behavior leading to more standardized comparisons. Thus we can see that tropical phenology differs from temperate phenology in two major ways. In tropical species, the nature of the pattern may change from one level of analysis to the next, which is not typical of temperate species. In many tropical species, phenological patterns vary more widely over the geographic range of a species than they do in temperate species.","NEWSTROM, LE

Periodic collections in Costa Rica between 1984 and 1991 included a low wet forest (La Selva Biological Station), a cloud forest (Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve), and a zone of premontane rain forest (Las Cruces Biological Station). A new trichomycete, Smittium phytotelmatum, that inhabits bloodworms (Chironomidae) was found primarily but not exclusively in bromeliads, and several axenic cultures of the fungus were obtained. A second, rarer, new species from a bromeliad bloodworm, S. fasciculatum, is also described, as is the new species Stachylina paludosa from swamp bloodworms. Two possibly hew but unnamed species of Smittium are described from lentic dipteran larvae. Mosquito, midge and ceratopogonid larvae were hosts to a geographically widespread Harpellales, Smittium culisetae. Bracts of Heliconia inflorescences, though often populated by mosquito larvae and other insects, contained no larvae with gut fungi. Water in Heliconia bracts averaged 2.36 pH units above that in bromeliads (average pH 5.02). It was demonstrated in the laboratory that Heliconia-inhabiting mosquito larvae maintained in their native water could be artificially infested with axenic cultures of S. culisetae. The apparent lack of natural fungal infestation of mosquito larvae in heliconias may be due to the ephemeral nature of the plants' water-holding bracts and extrinsic factors such as recruitment of fungal inoculum.","LICHTWARDT, RW","LICHTWARDT, RW",NA,"31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"48","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"APR-AUG",NA,"J",NA,"1994",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0034-7744","REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL",NA,"TRICHOMYCETE FUNGI LIVING IN THE GUTS OF COSTA-RICAN PHYTOTELM LARVAE

Nest densities at La Selva, Costa Rica were high (7.48 nests/m2) and potential nest sites were abundant. Colonies moved frequently (residence times for species ranged from 35 to 146 days) from one twig nest to another, occupying a wide range of twig types. Experiments with artificial nests showed that colonization was not reduced by the presence of resident ant colonies. Queenright nests (in which at least one queen is present) and queenless workers, as well as dealate queens, colonized artificial nests. Activity times and diet composition did not differ between the two species with largest sample sizes; workers were active under most conditions. Despite their abundance, twig-dwelling ants are apparently limited neither by availability of nest sites nor food.

We present data that demonstrate benefits of radio tracking in the study of rain forest primates. Data were collected during an ecological study of Ateles geoffroyi and Cebus capucinus in hilly, dense rain forest habitat with poor visibility, in northeastern Costa Rica. We show that radio tracking decreased search time for both species, which led to increased contact time and facilitated continuous data collection.
Mean search time for both primate species was significantly reduced using radio tracking (Kruskal-Wallis Test, P < 0.05). Search times for both species increased at the end of the study, when the transmitters ceased functioning. These increased search times occurred despite high levels of familiarity with the ranging patterns of the animals. The rate of marking feeding trees increased significantly with radio tracking and decreased significantly when the radios failed (Kruskal-Wallis Test, P < 0.01).
Other benefits of radio tracking include: finding animals far off trail, in dense vegetation, and in inclement weather; maintaining continuous contact with the animals, which allows for more complete knowledge of ranging and foraging patterns; and monitoring group and subgroup composition.

"462","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","We examined the hypothesis that tropical rain forest tree species differ significantly in the degree to which their regeneration is associated with treefall gaps. Using static and dynamic analyses, we evaluated crown light environments and forest structure around 0.5-5 m tall saplings (N = 424) of two pioneer and seven nonpioneer tree species in old growth tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Canopy photographs were taken with a fisheye lens directly above all individuals, Each photograph was analyzed to calculate a Global Site Factor (GSF), which is analogous to the percentage of photosynthetically active radiation reaching a site relative to a totally open site. The amount and directionality of crown illumination were also estimated visually using a crown position index (Dawkins & Field 1978, Clark & Clark 1992). Forest structure around each individual, a reflection of local disturbance history, was categorized as gap, building, or mature.
Saplings of all nine species were found in relatively dark sites (xBAR Global Site Factors 1.9-10.8%). The two pioneer species (Cecropia) were found in higher light microsites than the other species and were significantly different from each other. There were no significant differences in GSF among nonpioneer species. Results were similar for the direct and diffuse components of GSF, and for the crown position index. In contrast, forest structure around saplings varied significantly among nonpioneer species but not between Cecropia species.
For six of the nine species short-term height or diameter growth was correlated with GSF or its direct or diffuse components. GSF was weakly but significantly correlated with sapling height and crown position.
Analyses over time showed that all nine species had progressively lower crown illumination and fewer individuals in gap/building sites for 2-8 yr after initial encounter. Particularly steep decreases for Hyeronima and Pithecellobium saplings indicate that these species establish under canopy openings that subsequently fill in.
Canopy photography, crown position index, and the forest structure index all provided ecologically interpretable information. Only canopy photography distinguished between microsites of the two Cecropia species. Forest structure and crown position indices are rapid and inexpensive methods for obtaining long-term information on microhabitats around individual trees.
We found significant interspecific differentiation in microhabitat occupancy along a light gradient of only 0-25 percent of full sun. A crude 3-point index of forest structure revealed even further resolution. This study focused on only three microsite variables and a restricted size range of saplings. Comprehensive understanding of tropical tree regeneration will require long-term concurrent measurements of individual performance and associated environmental variables for all size classes of a broad range of species.","CLARK, DB

At La Selva Costa Rica, I related foraging activity at seed baits to humidity in two forests types. I recorded 38 and 35 ant species at seed baits in closed and open canopy forest. The microclimate 5 cm above the forest floor in the younger, Open Forest was warmer, drier, more variable, and more sensitive to current weather than in the older Closed Forest. Ant species within both forests foraged at different Vapor Pressure Deficits (kPa), a measure of the drying power of the air. VPD use was not confounded with diel activity patterns. Body size explained 46% of the variance in mean VPD use among ant species. Small ant species tended to forage in moist microclimates; large species tended to be microclimate generalists. Larger species were also more active in the drier Open Forest. Foraging activity by these assemblages varies 4-fold, and peaks close to the mean VPD for each habitat. The behavior of these assemblages suggest that 1) small ant species at La Selva potentially compete with the entire range of ant body sizes, whereas large ants forage when and where small ants are inactive; and 2) seeds dispersed to the forest floor at dawn will be consumed or further dispersed by a larger suite of ants species than those falling in the heat of the tropical afternoon.","KASPARI, M","KASPARI, M",NA,"500",NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/BF00320507",NA,"507","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"DEC",NA,"J",NA,"1993",NA,"Kaspari, Michael/0000-0002-9717-5768","28312456",NA,NA,"0029-8549","OECOLOGIA",NA,"BODY-SIZE AND MICROCLIMATE USE IN NEOTROPICAL GRANIVOROUS ANTS","WOS:A1993MU37600007","96",NA,NA,463

Within some growth forms of rainforest plants (lianas, understory shrubs), vegetative propagation may be the primary means of regeneration. In this study, the mode and frequency of vegetative propagation in 30 co-occurring species of the tropical shrub genus Piper at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica was assessed through field observations made over several months. Piper species were found to propagate by several means, including stem sprouting, root sprouting, layering, and fragmentation. The mode and frequency of propagation varied significantly among habitats and among species. Shade-tolerant Piper species typical of mid- and late-successional habitats regenerated primarily by vegetative means, especially layering and fragmentation, while shade-intolerant, early-successional species appeared to reproduce and disperse primarily by seed. These differences among Piper species in regeneration mode were due not only to environment, but also to a genetic component, as indicated by experiments investigating the importance of one means of vegetative propagation, fragmentation, to Piper species from different successional habitats. A shadehouse experiment showed that early-successional species were less likely than late-successional species to regenerate from detached fragments, independent of light regime. This outcome was corroborated by a transplant experiment in forest understory and large gaps comparing fragment vs. seedling survival among five Piper species from different stages of succession over a 7-mo period. Almost none of the cuttings from early-successional species survived in either habitat. Species of later successional stages survived better as fragments in the understory than in gaps; however, surviving fragments grew larger in gaps. Almost no seedlings from experimentally planted seeds of any species survived in either gaps or understory. Natural seedlings of early-successional Piper species were frequently found in large treefall gaps and other disturbances, while seedlings of species from later succession were seldom found in any habitat.","GREIG, N","GREIG, N",NA,"2125",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/1940857",NA,"2135","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"OCT",NA,"J",NA,"1993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","ECOLOGY",NA,"REGENERATION MODE IN NEOTROPICAL PIPER - HABITAT AND SPECIES COMPARISONS","WOS:A1993LY54900023","74",NA,NA,465

These paradigms are derived from studies of a small number of species whose life history traits place them easily into ''pioneer'' or ''climax'' species. Woody plants of the forest understory, subcanopy trees and shrubs, are known to affect significantly regeneration dynamics in treefall gaps, yet we lack fundamental information on life history characteristics of understory plants that could permit their incorporation into gap regeneration models. We investigated intra- and interspecific variability in early life history characteristics of understory Melastomataceae species of different growth forms and adult distributions from the lowland tropical rain forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. We examined germination patterns in vitro (22 species), effects on germination of passage through birds (5 species), seedling establishment in the field (3 species), and growth in different light environments (8 species).
Established seedlings were significantly more abundant in gaps than in nearby understory sites. This pattern was generally applicable to all melastomes studied, regardless of the habitat where adults were normally most abundant. Seedlings were more common in the root pits and on the root mounds of uprooted trees, even though there was less light available to the seedlings in these microsites than elsewhere in the gaps. In a series of germination trials in vitro, most seeds germinated readily within 1-2 wk. Comparisons of germination rates between seeds collected from bird droppings and seeds extracted from fruits by hand gave varied results. With one exception, seeds of shade-tolerant species germinated more slowly following passage through birds, while seeds from high-light-demanding species germinated more rapidly after passing through birds.
Seeds of three common species were sown directly into different microsites within gaps and understory control sites. In contrast to the germination trials, emergence percentages in the field ranged from 4% in understory sites to 21% in gap centers. Survival after 1 yr was low (0.1%-0.4%). After 1 yr, these seedlings were small (< 2 cm tall) and produced few leaves. In similar light environments in the shade-house, melastome seedling survival was between 80% and 100%, and growth increased with increasing light levels from 2% (corresponding to understory sites) to 20% (small gap centers) of full sun. With the exception of two species common to abandoned pastures and river banks, the species used in the shade-house growth experiments did not show significant increases in growth with increases in light from 20% to 40%. Suites of early life history traits described for tropical tree species are not consistent with the variation in pattern seen within this one family of understory species.","ELLISON, AM

"468","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","We describe the role of leaf-litter ants (Pheidole spp.) in the seed bank dynamics of several small-seeded shrubs in a Costa Rican lowland rain forest. These ants harvest seeds from frugivore feces and cache them in their nests in partially decomposed twigs. Most harvested seeds are eaten but some are placed in viable condition on refuse piles. From 24 to 38% of the colonies (depending on ant species) contain cached seeds and 25-32% have seeds on refuse piles. Experiments with captive colonies of Pheidole nebulosa and P. nigricula demonstrated that almost-equal-to 6% of harvested Miconia nervosa and M. centrodesma seeds are deposited on refuse piles. Because seeds generally retain viability longer than the nest twig remains intact, harvested seeds are not trapped inside twigs. Experimental plantings of 4-d-old Miconia nervosa seedlings on two types of substrate (ant refuse pile vs. topsoil) under two light levels (equivalent to small and large clearings) demonstrated that seedlings grew faster and survived better on refuse piles under light levels typical of small clearings. Light levels typical of large gaps are not necessarily advantageous for establishment of understory rain forest plants.
These results illustrate the dynamic nature of a tropical soil seed bank and the complexity of plant-animal interactions that occur there. Ants are simultaneously antagonistic and mutualistic towards seeds, killing most but significantly benefiting some. This interaction is extremely common (Pheidole density > 300 individuals/m2) and likely influences plant recruitment patterns. Our results challenge the generalizations that small seeds are largely protected from predation because of their size, that post-dispersal seed harvesting is equivalent to seed predation, that competition among seedlings from a frugivore defecation is common, and that small seeds accumulate over long periods of time in the seed bank. We hypothesize that differential harvesting and treatment of seeds by ant species may be a mechanism underlying community-level patterns of regeneration in small-seeded plants. Also, the incidental benefits to uneaten seeds deposited on refuse piles provide additional evidence that myrmecochory evolved in plants that strengthened rare but consistent benefits of being harvested by ''granivorous'' ants.","LEVEY, DJ

Quantum sensors attached to data loggers were operated continuously. Hemispherical photographs were taken monthly above the sensors. An additional quantum sensor was used to monitor PPFD outside the canopy. Sensor measurements show large differences between gap and closed-canopy locations and high daily and seasonal variability at each sensor location, with notable increases in solar radiation in gap stations during September and April. The photographs demonstrate that seasonal variation in PPFD results primarily from shifts in the solar angle relative to canopy openings and secondarily from variation in PPFD levels outside the canopy (cloudiness). Photographs also demonstrate an overall decrease in PPFD with time, for the gap stations, owing to vegetation regrowth. Analyses reveal excellent agreement between sensor PPFD measurements and estimates from hemispherical photographs. Long-term monitoring of PPFD enables calibration of hemispherical photography to permit estimation of PPFD with a high degree of reliability.","RICH, PM

Microtylopteryx hebardi (Acrididae:Ommatolampinae) at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, feeds on understorey palms as well as other understorey plants. We assessed leaf damage levels in populations of three geonomoid palm species (Geonoma cuneata, Geonoma congesta, Asterogyne martiana), investigated feeding response of M. hebardi to the three palms, and examined leaf characteristics presumed to be important to herbivores. In understorey and gap-edge habitats, total leaf damage did not differ significantly between palm species. In the centre of small light gaps, where M. hebardi was most abundant, total leaf damage and total herbivory on G. cuneata was equal to that on the other species, but herbivory attributable to grasshoppers was significantly greater. Female M. hebardi showed strong preference for G. cuneata over the other palm species in laboratory feeding trials. Experiments to elucidate the proximate basis for this feeding preference showed that grasshoppers preferentially bit filter paper discs containing cuticular wax extract of G. cuneata. In consumption and digestibility experiments, grasshoppers consumed more fresh weight of G. cuneata and gained more weight per unit time spent feeding on this species. Leaves of G. cuneata had the highest percentage water content, highest fresh and dry mass per unit leaf area, and the lowest percentage crude lignin among the three palms studied. These factors may partially explain the preference of M. hebardi for G. cuneata, which was reflected in higher herbivory rates incurred by G. cuneata in sites where M. hebardi was locally abundant.","BRAKER, E

Species were further separated into three life forms: self-supporting monocots, self-supporting dicots, and climbers.

In fact, mass-based nitrogen and phosphorus did not vary significantly among the three adult-stature classes, although area-based values differed greatly: canopy plants averaged 60 % more nitrogen and 90 % more phosphorus per unit leaf area than understory plants.
Differences in leaf characteristics were evident among the three life forms. Most notably, area-based phosphorus and leaf specific mass were lowest in climbers, intermediate in self-supporting dicots, and highest in self-supporting monocots.

Morphology and growth of sporophytes from reproductively mature populations at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica were studied. The presence of four morphologically different leaf types allowed plants to be classified into six life history stages, which in turn corresponded to relative age classes determined by counting nodes. One year's observations indicate that leaves are produced at a rate of 1.6 per year in reproductively mature populations. Approximate ages of sporophytes can be estimated from leaf counts in subadult individuals, and from the leaf length and number of leaflets on the longest sterile leaf in adults. The maximum life span of a sporophyte in reproductively mature populations is estimated to be at least 23 yr. The first vegetative propagules (ramets) from leaf tip buds are produced at an estimated mean plant age of 10 yr. Sexual maturity occurs approximately 3 yr after the first ramet has been produced. Leaf tip ramets become independent within a year after bud expansion and are located at a maximum distance of approximately 21 cm from the parent plant. The reproductively mature population samples studied showed substantial recruitment in the younger age classes.","SHARPE, JM","SHARPE, JM",NA,"85",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/2388981",NA,"94","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"MAR",NA,"J",NA,"1993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"PLANT-GROWTH AND DEMOGRAPHY OF THE NEOTROPICAL HERBACEOUS FERN

"477","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","To assess the diversity of tropical tree life histories, a conceptual framework is needed to guide quantitative comparative study of many species. We propose one such framework, which focuses on long-term performance through ontogeny and over the natural range of microsites. For 6 yr we annually evaluated survival, growth, and microsite conditions of six non-pioneer tree species in primary tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species were: Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Dipteryx panamensis, Pithecellobium elegans, Hyeronima alchorneoides (all emergents), and Minquartia guianensis (a canopy species). The study was based on long-term measurement of individuals from all post-seedling size classes. Trees were sampled from 150 ha of primary forest spanning several watersheds and soil types. To evaluate individuals' microsites we recorded the number of overtopping crowns, forest phase (gap, building, mature), and crown illumination index (an estimate of the tree's light environment). For comparison, we also evaluated the microsites of three species that have been categorized as pioneers (Cecropia insignis, C obtusifolia) or high-light demanders (Simarouba amara).
For the six species of non-pioneers, mortality rates declined with increasing juvenile size class. As a group, these emergent and canopy trees showed a much lower exponential annual mortality rate (0.44%/yr at > 10 cm diameter) than has been found for the La Selva forest as a whole. Growth rates increased with juvenile size class for all six species. As adults (trees > 30 cm in diameter), all five emergent species showed substantial annual diameter increments (medians of 5-14 mm/yr). Small saplings and adults of all species had significant year-to-year variation in diameter growth, with much greater growth occurring in the year of lowest rainfall. Passage time analysis suggests that all six species require > 150 yr for growth from small saplings to the canopy.
Evaluation of all nine species revealed four patterns of microsite occupancy by juveniles. Among the non-pioneers, one species pair (Lecythis and Minquartia: Group A) was associated with low crown illumination and mature-phase forest in all juvenile stages. For two species (Dipteryx and Hymenolobium: Group B) the smallest saplings were in predominantly low-light, mature-forest sites, but crown illumination and association with gap- or building-phase sites increased with juvenile size (Simarouba also showed this pattern). Two species (Pithecellobium and Hyeronima: Group C) were strongly associated with gap or building phase as small juveniles (less-than-or-equal-to 4 cm diameter) and again as subcanopy trees (> 10 - 20 cm diameter), but were predominantly in mature-phase sites at intermediate sizes. Juveniles of the two pioneer species (Cecropia: Group D) showed the highest crown illumination and association with gap or building sites.
Among the six non-pioneer species, only one aspect of juvenile performance clearly varied according to microsite group. The smallest saplings (less-than-or-equal-to 1 cm diameter) of Groups B and C showed significant mortality differences across a small gradient in crown illumination; neither of the Group A species showed this pattern. Otherwise, juvenile performance was strikingly similar among the six species. All showed a capacity for growth responses to small increases in light, substantial height and diameter increments at higher light levels, equal ability to survive 4-yr periods of no growth, and very low mortality rates at intermediate-to-large juvenile sizes. Species differed significantly in growth rates, but relative differences shifted with tree size and were unrelated to microsite group. These findings do not support prevailing paradigms concerning trade-offs and correlated suites of traits. For non-pioneer tropical trees, life history classification based on generalized concepts such as gap dependence and shade tolerance is inadequate to describe the complex size-dependent patterns of life history differences and similarities that exist among species.","CLARK, DA

In 1973, the third of a 4-yr population study of marked lek males, an unusual drought caused a severe flower shortage at the height of the breeding season. During the latter part of the breeding season lek activity of males was reduced, successful breeding by females was drastically curtailed, and masses of both sexes dropped to levels lower than those of the lean season. Interrupted molt, an indicator of energy stress normally seen only in a minority of breeding females, was observed in 25% of adult males, and 50% of females, in 1973. Survivorship of lek males through the breeding season dropped from 90% in normal years to almost-equal-to 60%, and the total lek population at the start of the 1974 breeding season was one-third lower than before the drought in 1973; the cohort of yearling males was most strongly affected. Recovery of numbers and age structure of the lek male population to pre-1973 levels required 3-4 yr. Jolly-Seber analyses showed close agreement with survivorship as determined by direct observation (possible because of the lek social system), and permitted estimation of other parameters of interest: populations of marked and unmarked males, probability of recapture of marked males, and recruitment. The average annual survivorship of male P. superciliosus (in normal years) is near the mean value reported for a series of tropical species. A simple model of the reproductive output of female P. superciliosus, assuming no sexual differences in survivorship, suggests that a female breeding only in the prime breeding season (roughly February-July, when over 80% of the fledglings are normally produced) will no more than replace herself in the population; breeding throughout 8-9 mo will permit her to increase her reproductive output by up to 10%, which agrees well with the 3+ yr required by the (male) population to recover from the drought. Possible implications of these findings for tropical bird demography and conservation are discussed.","STILES, FG","STILES, FG",NA,"1375",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/1940683",NA,"1390","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"AUG",NA,"J",NA,"1992",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","ECOLOGY",NA,"EFFECTS OF A SEVERE DROUGHT ON THE POPULATION BIOLOGY OF A TROPICAL

Therefore, we were able to quantify the effects of maternal family on mean seed weight and the effects of maternal family and microenvironment on the remaining traits examined. A significant effect of maternal family was detected for all traits. In particular, the maternal effects on germination date and seedling size traits which were consistently significant even after controlling the initial seed weight may indicate that the maternal effects reflect, at least to some extent, maternal genetic control over these traits. Despite overall strong maternal effects, the performance of maternal siblings, such as the rachis length, differed among blocks. The sensitivity of maternal siblings to the local environments may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variability in this highly outcrossing tropical species.","KANG, H

"482","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Because resource movement is restricted within and among branches of woody plants, different patterns of folivory are likely to differentially affect plant fitness. I examined experimentally the effects of folivory pattern on growth and seed output in the understory tropical wet forest shrub Piper arieianum (Piperaceae) in Costa Rica. I removed 10% of a plant's leaf area in two constrasting manners, either from a single reproductive branch or throughout the canopy. I also conducted the experiment at two times of year, 3 mo before flowering and during flowering, to determine the effects of damage relative to the phenology of reproduction. Leaf area was removed to simulate damage by natural folivores. I followed the effects of the removal for 1 yr, both for experimental plants and for control plants from which no leaf area was removed.
Response to experimental folivory varied by treatment both at the branch and whole plant level. When 10% of a plant's leaf area was removed from single reproductive branches 3 mo before the main flowering season, those damaged branches grew less and produced 80% fewer viable seeds than did similar branches on control plants and plants that lost 10% of their leaf area, but with the losses scattered throughout the plant. These differences among treatments for individual branches translated into differences over the entire plant: plants with damage concentrated on one reproductive branch grew less overall and produced fewer seeds than plants of the other two treatments. Thus, restricted movement of resources in P. arieianum following leaf damage to single reproductive branches resulted in decreased whole plant fitness. When this same experiment was conducted at the time of flowering, there were no differences among treatments in seed production or growth, either at the branch or plant level. Results of these two experiments demonstrate that the effects of folivory are dependent on the timing of the loss relative to the reproductive phenology of the plant; resources necessary for fruit production are accumulated before flowering and not subsequent to it in P. arieianum. In 32% of plants in which damage was concentrated, seed production was reduced due to either abortion of the damaged branch (17%) or abortion of its bud inflorescences (15%). In the remaining 68% of branch-defoliated plants, neither level nor timing of flowering was affected by the experimental folivory, suggesting that reduction in seed production was due to a decrease in resource availability and not to a lack of pollinator visitation.
Together these results add to the evidence that resource movement is restricted in woody plants, even in the face of a stress such as herbivory. The results further suggest that relatively small amounts of folivory can have major detrimental effects in woody plants and that damage pattern as well as damage level must be measured.","MARQUIS, RJ","MARQUIS, RJ",NA,"143",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/1938727",NA,"152","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"FEB",NA,"J",NA,"1992",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","ECOLOGY",NA,"A BITE IS A BITE IS A BITE - CONSTRAINTS ON RESPONSE TO FOLIVORY IN

Nitrogenase activity in W. georgii appeared to be associated with both filamentous cyanobacteria which were loosely intertwined with leafy liverworts, and a thin layer of coccoid cyanobacteria lying immediately above the leaf cuticle. Rates of N2 fixation, measured using N-15(2), in direct sunlight, were high, averaging 37.5-mu-g N cm-2 h-1, while rates at light values typically found in the understory (ca.12-mu-E m-2 sec-1) averaged 1.8-mu-g cm2 h-1 suggesting that autotrophs (cyanobacteria) were the principal diazotrophs. Contribution of epiphyllae N2 fixation on W.georgii at La Selva, Costa Rica, is conservatively estimated to be 270 mg N ha-1 day-1.

To determine leaf longevity and causes of mortality for a species in the understory of a neotropical rain forest, we studied 634 leaves on 173 individuals of the cycad shrub Zamia skinneri for 10 yr at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Five different seasonal cohorts of leaves were followed. No significant differences among cohorts were found in median leaf longevity, but the cohorts did differ in the proportion of leaves dying in annual intervals from < 1 to greater-than-or-equal-to 6 yr. Median minimum time alive for all leaves was 4.6 yr. Epiphyll coverage increased from 0% in the first year of life to 75%-100% by year 4. Leaf mortality was well described by two separate exponential functions, approximately 10% mortality/yr until year 4, then abruptly increasing to ca. 51%/yr. Of 625 leaf deaths, 77.0% were due to unexplained causes, 16.5% to physical damage by falling litter, 4.8% to attacks by larvae of the lycaenid butterfly Eumaeus minyas, and 1.8% to other causes. Leaf longevity was positively correlated with leaf size. Individuals of Z. skinneri frequently survive more than a century in very dark understory conditions. We suggest that leaf longevity in these circumstances is determined by the inevitable deterioration in leaf carbon balance due to leaf aging and increasing epiphyll coverage, and by loss due to physical damage and attacks by the specialist herbivore.","CLARK, DB

"487","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","Dilute geothermal springs of the sodium-chloride-bicarbonate type modify the chemistry of receiving screams draining La Selva Biological Reserve in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica.  Streams receiving geothermal waters are solute-rich and co-occur with solute-poor streams that do not receive geothermal inputs.  Geothermal waters contain significantly greater concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mg, Na, Si, Cl, SO4, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus (TP) than waters unmodified by geothermal inputs.  Streams that do not receive geothermal inputs are solute-poor, typically containing < 10 percent relative concentration of each of the solutes mentioned above.  Most geothermal waters that have been identified to date issue near the terminus of the youngest lava flow known for La Selva.  The two major rivers of La Selva, the Salto and Suta, are both modified by inputs of geothermal waters and their main channels follow the lateral margins of the youngest lava flow, where it overlies older flows.  Discharge points of geothermal seepages appear to be determined by the shape and hydrogeological properties of the lava flows and possible faulting.  The lower watershed of the Salto River exhibits a large spatial variability in phosphorus concentration (5-250-mu-g L-1 SRP) and conductivity (25-440-mu-S cm1) that reflects the heterogeneous location of geothermal seepages.  Geothermal processes introduce natural chemical discontinuities into stream continua that can affect nutrient limitation of algal growth and potentially primary production.  In addition, geothermal upwellings represent a source of variation in soil phosphorus levels that is relatively independent of the composition of parent material in the surficial catchment and may potentially influence plant growth and demography.","PRINGLE, CM","PRINGLE, CM",NA,"523",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/2388390",NA,"529","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"DEC",NA,"J",NA,"1991","Pringle, Catherine/I-1841-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","BIOTROPICA",NA,"GEOTHERMALLY MODIFIED WATERS SURFACE AT LA SELVA BIOLOGICAL STATION,

"488","LaSelvaPT_1-500.txt","The effects of different light and soil nutrient conditions on foliar chemistry and acceptability of Inga oerstediana seedlings to leaf-cutter ants were investigated. I determined differences among (1) leaves that were initiated and matured under identical conditions but subsequently were subjected to different light and fertilization treatments and (2) leaves that were initiated and matured under different soil, light, and fertilization treatments. I also assessed the relationship between environmentally induced differences in plant growth and the production of carbon-based secondary chemicals (specifically, tannins). Finally, I determined whether increases in tannins corresponded to decreases in the acceptability of leaves to leaf-cutter ants.
Once a leaf matured the concentrations of tannins did not change as a function of light and soil nutrient conditions despite very large differences in growth rates among the treatments. Leaves that expanded to maturity under different soil, light, and fertilization treatments did differ in tannin chemistry, and treatment differences in plant growth rates appeared to dictate tannin chemistry. When growth was light limited, tannin concentrations were low, but when growth was nutrient limited, tannin concentrations were high.
Only leaves that expanded to maturity under different environmental conditions differed in their acceptability to leaf-cutter ants. Decreases in tannins did not result in parallel increases in acceptability. Despite higher concentrations of tannins, leaf-cutter ants preferred the leaves of seedlings that were grown at 20% light over leaves of seedlings grown at 2% light. However, fertilization increased the acceptability of leaves when seedlings were grown at 20% light, a result consistent with the avoidance of very-high-tannin leaves.
From these results I suggest that spatial variation in resource availability in lowland tropical rainforests would result in differences in tannin chemistry, and in susceptibility to leaf-cutter ants. However, temporal changes in resource availability would only be important to tannin chemistry and susceptibility if the duration of the change were long enough to allow new leaves to be produced.","NICHOLSORIANS, CM","NICHOLSORIANS, CM",NA,"1609",NA,NA,NA,"10.2307/1940961",NA,"1623","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"OCT",NA,"J",NA,"1991",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","ECOLOGY",NA,"ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED DIFFERENCES IN PLANT TRAITS - CONSEQUENCES FOR

2.  Four species of sandfly, Lutzomyia shannoni Dyar, L. trapidoi F. & H., L. ylephiletor F. & H. and L. vespertilionis F. & H. comprising 97% of those caught, used tree buttresses as diurnal resting sites.  Their distribution on the buttresses was aggregated.
3.  During the dry season tree species had no significant effect upon the distribution of the sandflies.  However, during the wet season the distributions of two of the species, L. trapidoi and L. ylephiletor, were significantly affected by the species of tree; it is suggested that some species of tree may provide greater protection from rainfall than others.
4.  L. vespertilionis was restricted to a single buttress on each positive tree.  Distribution of this species is evidently determined by the distribution of its host animal, the bat (Emballonuridae).  Female flies feed upon the bat's blood and male flies may be attracted to the bat as it provides a source of female sandflies.  It is suggested, therefore, that tree buttresses serve as sandfly swarming sites.
5.  Within a large buttress the sandflies are not randomly distributed but are aggregated in particular areas.  Within these aggregations, the sandflies are vertically zoned upon the buttress with a shift in species composition with height.  Two hypothesis were suggested to account for this distribution pattern:  a response to an environmental gradient or an interaction between the four species of fly.","MEMMOTT, J","MEMMOTT, J",NA,"403",NA,NA,NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2915.1991.tb00568.x",NA,"411","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"OCT",NA,"J",NA,"1991",NA,NA,"1773118",NA,NA,"0269-283X","MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY",NA,"SANDFLY DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE IN A TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST","WOS:A1991GQ09800003","5",NA,NA,489

(2) For all species combined, frequency of damage varied from 9 to 27% among five size classes. Frequency of damage was negatively correlated with diameter growth rates for stems 1-30 cm in diameter. (3) Rates of damage due to falling litter ranged from 1 to 7% year-1 for trees up to 30 cm in diameter. Calculated half-lives until death or damage due to falling litter increased from 10 years for stems less-than-or-equal-to 1 cm in diameter to 63 years for stems 10-30 cm in diameter. (4) Rates of mortality were higher in damaged individuals than in undamaged plants for stems up to 10 cm in diameter. Absolute rates of mortality decreased with increasing stem diameter, but the relative contribution of physical damage as an agent of mortality increased with stem diameter. Litterfall caused at least 20% of the mortality of stems less-than-or-equal-to 1 cm in diameter, and accounted for 41% of the deaths of stems 1-30 cm in diameter. (5) Damage and death due to falling litter are important factors affecting plant regeneration throughout the humid neotropics.

Fruit abundance varied seasonally in each habitat but was consistently greatest in the youngest site.  Frugivores and nectarivores accounted for four (forest and older successional) or five (younger successional) of the five most frequently captured bird species in each habitat.  Capture rates of arboreal frugivores and arboreal frugivore-insectivores were greatest in the youngest site and were not different between older habitats.  Temporal variation in capture rates of frugivores resulted from habitat shifts by resident individuals and from arrival and departure of altitudinal and latitudinal migrants.  Capture rates of frugivores correlated with fruit abundance in forest and the older successional habitat but not in the youngest site.  Capture rates of nectarivores and insectivores varied over time and among habitats, but rates showed no correlation with capture rates of frugivores.  The lack of positive correlations in seasonal capture rates among trophic groups and the correlation between frugivores and fruit abundance support the view that temporal and spatial variation in bird abundance in tropical bird communities is at least partially in response to variation in resource abundance.","BLAKE, JG

Because green fruits are probably less conspicuous than other colors of fruits, their pigmentation cannot be attributed to the attraction of seed dispersers.  Instead, we hypothesize that a major benefit of green pigmentation is the ability to photosynthesize when ripe.  Photosynthesis by fruits may lower their costs of production, and could result in fruits with greater nutrient reward.  We present data on physical, chemical, and photosynthetic characteristics of ripe fleshy fruit of variable colors for 28 plant species at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica.  In addition to color and morphological characteristics of pulp and seeds, we report soluble solids content (refractive index), and photosynthetic/respiratory carbon-dioxide balance of ripe fruits.  Carbon balance was much more dependent upon ambient light levels in green-ripe fruits than in bright-ripe fruit.  In particular, data from light response curves indicated that green-ripe fruits may go into positive carbon balance at high light levels (above 300-mu-mol/m2/s).  Rather than finding a positive relationship between soluble solids content and green fruit, as we predicted based on photosynthetic capacity, our data indicate that greater respiration rates of green-ripe fruits may result in carbon losses at low light levels.  Our results were consistent with previously described morphological differences between the two color classes, with green-ripe fruits displaying significantly greater wet pulp mass, wet seed mass, and total fruit mass.  Our data suggest that photosynthesis due to the retention of chlorophyll in ripe fleshy fruit may offset respiratory costs for plants with large or otherwise costly fruit, but this advantage should be evident only under high-light conditions.","CIPOLLINI, ML

The distribution of sizes of seedlings corresponds qualitatively to what is expected.  There were few seedlings larger than 4.5 cm, representing individuals that already had been exposed to a light gap and which therefore had grown rapidly.  The majority of the individuals in the population had been degrowing due to their position in the understory.  The general survivorship of seedlings was 61 %.  The mean of the rate of growth was approximately -0.09 cm/ano (the mean of the width of leaflets) a statistic which may leave a false impression.  The rate of growth is related to the size of the seedling in a complicated non-linear manner, in which very small individuals grow relatively rapidly, intermediate individuals ""degrow"" (actually decrease in size over time), and larger seedlings also grow rapidly.  Using a model modified after Leflkowitch it is observed that the population of seedlings appears to be stable in the distribution of stages.","VANDERMEER, J","VANDERMEER, J",NA,"7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"20","Clarivate Analytics Web of Science",NA,"JUN",NA,"J",NA,"1990",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0034-7744","REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL",NA,"GROWTH AND SURVIVAL OF WELFIA-GEORGII SEEDLINGS IN A RAIN-FOREST OF THE
